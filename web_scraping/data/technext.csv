‘Product Managers are in the middle of business, tech and UX’- Gloria Ojukwu, founder of Hertechtrail	"The question, “What do product managers do?” comes up pretty often, even from experienced business people. What you should know is that Product Managers are often at the intersection between the tech and business sides of products. Product management is an evolving career path, but managers usually have a wide-ranging area of responsibilities. Indeed, the role itself means very different things in different organisations.
This is the story of Gloria Ojukwu, a Product Manager at Nihongo Master, a Japanese learning platform. Gloria is a graduate of Computer science from Niger Delta University, Wilberforce Island, Bayelsa, and has been in the tech space for over ten years. 


The last child of six originally wanted to be a medical doctor, a choice her parents agreed with. This was until her physics/further maths teacher in secondary school informed her of other career choices apart from the ones the students were familiar with. She found out that she had the ability to succeed in the emerging tech space. So, when she filled out her UTME form to get into the university, she choose Computer Science as her first and second choice. 
I only told my family after because I knew that they were going to try to discourage me.Gloria Ojukwu, Product Manager
According to her, this decision was what marked the beginning of her career in the tech space. Although Gloria is now a Product Manager, she started out as a web developer. She describes her PM journey as ‘accidental’ because she used to work in a company where the PM role was non-existent. She took it on as part of her work because of her interest in understanding the business outcomes of the products she worked on.
‘I had passion for code and also wanted to see what drives the product for growth. What are the things that make this product excel and put smiles on the faces of the user?’

The company then recognised the need for a product manager and put her in that role. Coincidentally, when she got another job, she also started out as a front end engineer but then, the existing PM resigned. The company asked for volunteers to fill in the role in the meantime and Gloria stepped up. She excelled in the role and thus decided to choose Product Management as her career path.
Product Managers are in the middle of business, tech and UX. I already had the tech experience. I naturally always want to know the business outcomes of the products and that’s how I started. Since then, it has been Product Management.
Having to interface between development and design teams and also studying metrics to understand the business aspect of a product seems like a handful. Gloria loves being a product manager.
‘Product Managers lead the direction of the product. I take pride in the fact that my ideas become product features, one that people are willing to pay for. It tells me that I’m valuable. It makes users happy and helps the organisation I’m working with hit their business goals.’
A woman of many hats 
Gloria enjoys speaking at events
Gloria manages the Atlassian community for product managers, developers and designers. She trains other Product Managers in Utiva, a platform that delivers a collaborative and cohort-based learning model which allows people access quality technology skills. 
She is a Google women tech makers ambassador, a recommendation that came due to her role as co-lead for Google Developer Groups in her community.
Gloria is also an active member of diverse communities with a focus on product management. She considers these communities a necessity as the project management space is just emerging. She mentions a lack of resources in the space when she started her journey. 
Most of the challenges were in the beginning, especially with the lack of resources. If you don’t have experience in product management, you go online but it’s all theory. There is no practical aspect, at least when I started. Access to resources was a pain point for me then. I learnt on my own due to this.
Another challenge she mentions is the lack of mentors. There were few product managers to look up to when she started. The available ones were in the Big Tech companies and so out of reach for beginners. 
‘The product management space in Nigeria is still emerging. Then, it was difficult although it’s easier now. For me, I grow by having mentors – people I look up to. I am active in product management communities. Being a part of these communities is a hands-on experience.  In these communities, we share experiences and lessons. This has helped me stay in the game and has helped me grow.’
Helping others grow 

All the challenges Gloria faced on her journey influenced her decision to launch Hertechtrail, on November 30, 2019, with the intention to help ladies get started in tech careers.
Before officially launching Hertechtrail, Gloria was trying to personally mentor people interested in the tech space. However, it became overwhelming due to the number of people trying to learn. She then created a platform for other people who understood the mission to help others grow in the space, the platform that is now Hertechtrail.
The fact that I didn’t have direct access to the people I looked up to was a problem, coupled with limited resources. I didn’t want others to face the challenges I faced hence Hertechtrail. I wanted the average African woman to do tech without a lack of barriers.
In almost 3 years, Hertechtrail has been able to reach 2000 women indirectly and 500 women directly through the Hertechtrail academy. The academy is a virtual one and tuition-free with different tracks of learning. These tracks include UI/UX design, Web Development, Product Management, Product Design, Data Analysis, Digital Marketing and Web Design with WordPress. Top students in the academy are then connected to companies as interns and 20% of them now have entry roles. 
On women inclusion in Tech
According to Gloria, few women are willing to mentor other women because they are mostly new entrants and also unsure of their future in the space. As someone who has been in the space for a while, Gloria says she has not worked with a female developer during the course of her work. 
She says “it sucks” because it points to the fact that there is more work to be done in the aspect of inclusion. With Hertechtrail, Gloria has given interested women a platform to help others as about 70% of coaches and volunteers are women. 
‘The most passionate thing I do currently is not just being able to practice as a Product Manager but also helping other people come into the space, giving them the knowledge and experience they need and building a platform for women to get support in tech.’
Gloria considers her brainchild to be a source of pride and also a challenge.
Knowing that I’m serving as a role model to other African women is a source of pride and challenge. It tells me I have a lot of work to do and that I have to do it the right way.
Product management is a continuous role, so when Gloria is not checking for blockers or looking out for bugs in product codes, she reads business-related books and surfs the internet for funny videos.

Damilola Oluwatunmise: The coding knight taking tech skills to low-income women	"Oluwaranti Damilola Oluwatunmise is the founder of CreativePluck Limited and CodeSchool Africa, a digital product studio that has served clients across several verticals as well as created innovative business solutions for businesses.
Through its training arm, CodeSchool Africa, CreativePluck aims to make digital skills common among Africans starting with Nigeria. 


Damilola is determined to arm people with the relevant digital skills to enable them compete in an increasingly digital workplace and world. 
She believes that “the future of work is digital, the world is becoming more and more of a digital space every day” which is why she seeks to empower people with the necessary digital skills to survive the fast-growing digital world and workspace.”
Damilola, an Alumni of the Academy for Women Entrepreneur (AWE) by the US Consulate, Lagos, a Goldman Sach’s 10,000 Women Alumni, is also a TechWomen Program 2022 semi-finalist and has received certificates such as Central Bank of Nigeria Entrepreneurship Development Centre; Business training certificate. Damilola has a mini-MBA with Future Female Business School (By FFBS and UK-Nigeria Tech Hub), and she is also an Associate Member of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR).
The graduate of Mass Communication always knew she would pivot into tech, as she “never saw herself practising journalism or working in traditional media. I just wasn’t passionate about it, it didn’t interest me so much nor was it something I wanted to do on a full-time basis.”
Her first interest lay in digital marketing which led her to her first job as a digital marketer; starting her digital marketing agency after – a role that exposed her to tech.
CEO, Creative Pluck, Damilola Oluwatunmise

She learned other skills like how to build a website and coding, which paved the way for her full transition into tech. CreativePluck was the result. 
Spotting the need
COVID-19 and the lockdown happened and that brought an opportunity.
I heard in the news that about 72,000 Nigerians lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and that led me to realise we had a digital skills gap. I realised such a huge gap in digital skills existed because people weren’t being taught the way that they could learn. Damilola Oluwatunmise
Being a tactile learner herself, which is a learning type that requires learning physically, and interaction with her tutors, she understood how this could be hampering young Nigerians from acquiring digital skills which could help them work from anywhere in the world, and she set out to do something about it. 
This led to CodeSchool Africa and subsequently, She Codes Africa, where they teach women who are interested in relevant digital skills.
“What we set to do with CodeSchool Africa is to ensure everyone has access to learning digital skills in the way they want to learn. 
“I realised how important this was because in one of the instructor-led Bootcamp classes we organised, we were having a web development class using bootstrap and the instructor asked if the participants understood and several of the participants gave honest feedback that they didn’t understand. 
“That was when the vision hit home, it really struck me that the challenge many were having wasn’t the teaching it was about the interactivity of the classes; being able to interact and engage with the students. 
“If we say we want to make premium digital skills available then we must give people the options to learn in the way they are most comfortable with and how they want to learn, either online or offline.” 
Code School Africa class in session 
The goal of CodeSchool Africa
CodeSchool Africa has a goal to expose suburban African youths across the continent to digital skills like Programming, Full Stack Web-Development, Application Development, Product Management, AI/Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Digital Marketing, UI/UX design etc, using a blended (physical and classroom) learning approach.
CodeSchool Africa currently has Six Schools (courses) running with some of these courses using blended learning, while some are in-person programs to ensure the right interactivity of students learning to maximally learn from the course.
CodeSchool Africa courses are made to be over 50% more affordable than the industry’s standard.
“We have a flexible payment plan, that is, students can pay in instalments. There are different courses but we have courses priced as low as 30,000 naira for four weeks. 
“Our UI/UX Web Development classes are 60,000 naira for eight weeks’ intensive classes, as against industry standard which start from 120,000 naira. Data Analytics Accelerator program also goes for the same as UI/UX and both Data Analytics and UI/UX program can be taken both in-person and online
Since the idea began in 2019, CodeSchool Africa has trained over 350 students through its free boot camps as well as paid classes, with its first physical training centre located in Ibadan, Oyo, for in-person training, 
“What makes us unique is that we ensure our courses are 50% less expensive and you get a mentor assigned to you, which you have guaranteed access to three months after the completion of your course, and probably longer.”
We help our students build their portfolios as this will help them get jobs, so we ensure our students do capstone projects, build their portfolios as a student, we have a hands-on approach because we see ourselves as birthing mothers which do not leave their children until they can stand on their own.Damilola Oluwatunmise
Expanding the vision
After the vision became clear, Damilola and her team started CodeSchool Africa in Lagos where they teach digital skills like coding, UI/ UX design, etc. 
“We realised that most code schools are often located in urban areas and those who are privileged to live within that vicinity, thereby segmenting those in less urban areas and depriving them of the opportunity to learn these skills that are highly in demand today. Our primary aim is to reach those likely to be sidelined in smaller cities, teach them these skills while making it very affordable,” Damilola says. 
Beyond her vision of taking coding skills to all, Damilola’s vision of CodeSchool Africa gave birth to She Codes Africa to include teaching low-income women or girls who are interested in learning premium digital skills but are unable to afford it free of charge. 
The vision is practically to teach women and girls in rural areas these digital skills. We started in Ibadan teaching these skills in a girl’s school but we are still pretty much at the beginning stages. Damilola Oluwatunmise
“I got the idea after observing that oftentimes when we are paid to train people, most can’t afford to pay to acquire these skills and I believe they have a right to learn them. As a woman, my passion is for empowering women and breaking the bias. So, I thought the best thing to do is to teach them these skills free of charge as a means of empowerment. 
“Indeed, women are taking their place in the tech space, becoming powerhouses but if we look at the statistics, it is mostly women from urban and privileged backgrounds, leaving out the not so privileged and those in rural areas. This is why this platform, She Codes takes these skills to them.”
She Codes Africa in session
Bias against women in tech?
Damilola Oluwatunmise recalls an experience when she lost a contract because she attended a meeting without a male partner as the client seemed to be expecting.
“I once went in for a meeting alone, where the client wanted to build an e-learning platform which was really my company’s forte. But, as I walked in for the meeting, the person presiding said ‘oh are we still waiting for someone else?’ I was surprised and said no. They replied, ‘so you are the one for the meeting?’ 
The founder of She Codes Africa narrates how those kinds of biases have eaten deep, especially in this part of the world. 
“I ended up not getting that contract probably due to some bias they had. These are some of the challenges women have to surmount to succeed in our society.”
Advise for newcomers
Tech doesn’t bite. I always advise students to demystify tech, start from the easier things then move up. you don’t need to know mathematics to do some roles. I am personally terrible at mathematics but today I have a start-up.Damilola Oluwatunmise
She goes further to explain that is ‘tech’ is not as technical as many think of it. 
“If I can do it anyone can. I started in digital marketing, then moved up to web design, then continued to move up as I mastered one and my confidence and knowledge grew. 
“So, do what works for you and learn what you need at your own pace. If you like to learn online or in-person do that, but ensure you know what works for you because if you do something that doesn’t really suit you, fatigue sets in and you begin to lose interest in something you used to be excited about.”

Women in Tech: Ikiokaye Idowu shares her crossover story from banking to tech	"For many women, being part of the tech industry has provided successful and rewarding careers. This is the story of Ikiokaye Idowu, a Biochemistry graduate of Lagos State University who started her career in the banking sector but is now an Operations Manager with Tek Experts, a company that offers deep technical support and professional services for blue-chip technology companies.
There is a certain sense of false stability and security that comes with being in the banking sector. At least that was how Idowu may have felt. She described the banking sector, where she worked as a Customer Service Agent as monotonous and non-challenging. 


 “The operations were dull and not challenging so I needed something else to challenge me. I wanted to focus on building my career, the banking sector wasn’t it and I wasn’t comfortable in that space”, she said. 
Journey into tech

Her quest for something more challenging and progress in her career led her to seek opportunities in different companies. Joining Tek Experts changed the trajectory of her career.
Idowu applied to Tek Experts as a Support Engineer and resigned from the bank to resume her new job. This was in 2018. As a Support Engineer, she attended to the needs of Microsoft customers in the billing aspect.
An obvious note of satisfaction was evident when Idowu shared her experiences in the tech industry. She has finally arrived at a fulfilling destination after 8 years of unexciting work.  “It’s awesome and challenging. It’s never a stable environment, always new things to challenge your intellect and focus. It has been quite interesting,” she says.  
Within three years in the tech industry, she has quickly climbed the ranks from Support Engineer to being Operations Manager. On her way to being Operations Manager, she also served as Team Manager and Section Manager.  
Now, there is no fear of monotonous work as she always has something new to learn in order to properly manage operations. This has also helped in her self-development. 
There’s always something different added to the operations. When you think you got your hands on everything you need to know, something new comes up that you need to learn. It helps to develop yourself. 
Adapting to the tech industry

As much as she enjoys the different twists that come with being an Operations Manager, keeping up with the pace is a challenge. She is however glad to tackle those challenges. According to her, the challenges are to her advantage since it requires her to learn new things in order to keep up.
“Keeping up with the pace is very challenging and you get to learn new things. You need to give your all to be able to keep up,” she noted.
Idowu attributes her growth in Tek Experts to belief in her herself and some quality mentoring. She describes herself as someone who is not comfortable with back-benching and so she contributes her own quota.
Training and opportunities for career development organised by her company have also been instrumental in her growth. Supportive colleagues also constantly offer encouragement and drive to do better, and do more. 
What I have not been able to achieve in 8 years in the banking sector, I have done tremendously well just within 3 years in Tek experts.
Speaking of work values, Idowu says she has learnt quite a lot. Two things that stand out are collaboration and sharing of knowledge. Compared to the banking sector where she worked before, people guarded their knowledge because of fear that your own understanding could put them out of their jobs.
At Tek Experts, the core values are working together, knowledge matters and customer first. These values have additionally helped her to build her career.
Ladies need to challenge themselves to take up certain roles

Increasing gender diversity in the tech sector, and working towards inclusive culture in firms, is an ongoing process in the technology sector.  Though efforts are being made to increase representation, progress is slow and this is a fact that Ikiokaye Idowu acknowledges.
According to Idowu, many ladies are not challenging themselves to take up certain roles because they think the roles are male-dominated. 
“We still have many ladies out not challenging themselves to take up certain roles because they think it’s a male-dominated role,” she said.
She says Tek Experts is heavily dominated by the male gender with 74% and 26% female.
However, this is not because the company lacks an open door policy. It knows that there is still a lot to be done and so they have partnered with Microsoft to drive female-specific programs where they upskill women without IT backgrounds across different Microsoft technologies.  
This partnership started in 2019 and from then till date, Tek Experts has completed 2 cohorts and recruited about 40 women to work. “That’s still a drop in the ocean but we’re working hard to drive programs to ensure that more women come into the space.”
Women don’t need tech background to succeed in the industry

Idowu thinks women mentoring women programs are very vital in helping more women wishing to carve out a career in tech. She was part of a workplace initiative where female supervisors served as mentors and regards the feedback as inspiring. 
She also advocated for the establishment of conferences and programs in schools to help young girls adopt tech as a career from a young age.
“Additionally, there should be women conferences in schools to encourage young ladies to join,” she said.
Her advice to young women looking to go into tech is for them to come as they are. Idowu herself does not possess tech skills, so to speak but she’s doing well in the industry.
 You don’t necessarily have to have technical knowledge or have computer based certification. There are avenues to train you at your own pace.
Evidently, the industry still has a great way to go before it can be seen as providing equal opportunities for women. Right now, however, women need to fight the prejudice that they are not techy or not knowledgeable enough.

FashTracker CEO, Wunmi Akinsola, discusses the amazing fusion of tech and African fashion	"Africa-inspired fashion designs are the real deal these days. Designs are regularly shown on the catwalks in Paris, London, and Milan fashion shows, and Wunmi Akinsola is in on this deal.  
Wunmi Akinsola grew up in a world of fashion. As the last of five girls, she describes growing up as chaotic in a good way with fashion, laughter, and fights interspersed. Wunmi’s sisters ran a fashion brand in London and her work there marked the beginning of her path in the fashion industry.


Now the CEO of Fashtracker, a startup that deals in African fashion, she admits that seeing her sisters in the space was an influence on her current career path.
They gave me the boldness to go into it and also made it ok for me to establish myself in the fashion space as they already had a level of success in their careers in the industry.Wunmi Akinsola
The graduate of Fashion and Textile from the University of Kent, England, enjoyed the support of her family as her mother also encouraged her to study the course due to Wunmi’s evident passion for fashion.
During her time working with her sisters, she was the brand coordinator, where she was responsible for social media, communicating with manufacturers and buyers, and doing e-commerce functions. Wunmi had her hands in all the nitty-gritty that made the business move, and she was able to acquire knowledge that now serves her in her own business.
 It helped me to learn so many things that i use today. I count myself lucky to have these sorts of people guiding me because I know that a lot of my peers do not have that.
Wunmi’s first business was Pearls and Portraits, a B2B African-inspired fashion print outlet where she designed clothing pieces and supplied other retailers after production. She started this business as a graduate, so it was a struggle for her then.

“It was a struggle because I was much younger and had limited experience within the industry. I made a lot of mistakes but I learned from them.”
Building ASOS of Africa 
Some members of Fashtracker team
Wunmi worked as the head of the Women’s fashion category at Jumia, and it was here she was exposed to the intricacies of the fashion industry. She saw the gaps during her time there and decided to start her enterprise to provide better services.
I started the company because I wanted to focus on a niched fashion focus for e-commerce. I wanted to work in an african equivalent of ASOS but it didn’t exist so I decided to start one.
Fashtracker is an African marketplace that showcases African fashion in different forms – clothing and accessories. The mission for Wunmi, in the beginning, was to build ASOS, an online fashion and cosmetic retailer with over 850 brands, as well as its range of clothing and accessories that it ships to countries worldwide.
A particular realisation dawned on her quickly – that Africa is a different market, although she envies ASOS’ speed, efficiency, and innovation, a height she aspires to. 
‘The core elements of ASOS are selling attainable fashion products to the average consumer, which is the core of Fashtracker, too, except that it is African fashion.’
Fashtracker started in August 2020 where they recorded 50% quarter on quarter growth. Almost two years on, she describes the journey as being fun and also a learning curve.
I think entrepreneurship is really a massive learning curve. You learn so much about yourself and I think Fashtracker has helped me to become a little bit more self aware.
As expected, running any business has its own challenges. Wunmi says Fashtracker’s most pressing challenge is logistics, especially as she is looking to bring delivery time to less than a week. Another challenge is ensuring standardisation of products with the about 50 brands that are listed on Fashtracker.
Future of Fashtracker and African fashion 

While searching for a dress for her friend, Wunmi discovered that the foreign fashion scene lacked a fresh touch. Then, she discovered that African fashion is starting to become the first choice because of its uniqueness, high quality, and commercial viability.
“For a range of reasons, we discovered that we recently had a spike in traction from Saudi Arabia and just from speaking to people who made inquiries, we saw that they wanted what African fashion had to offer.”
On the question of funding, Wunmi answers that Fashtracker, which currently is a team of 5 women is being self funded using proceeds from her first company, Pearls and Portraits. Now that she is focused on being the CEO of Fashtracker, she has a team in place to manage the former.
On September 20, 2021, Akinsola’s fashion-tech startup, Fashtracker, won TechCabal’s Future of Commerce pitch contest. Wunmi was also recently a winner in the Standard Chartered Women in Technology Incubator programme (SC-WITI) in Nigeria, one that saw her receive up to $10, 000.
Wunmi is open to securing funding but first, she wants to build a sustainable company, one that she considers an important value.
Fashtracker is working on Skinntracker, a category where cosmetic and skincare brands are listed, an indication of its ambition to become a big retailer.
What I would like to see fashtracker become is sort of the same level globally as asos but for African fashion. I hope Fashtracker is able to globalise and commercialize its products.
Woman in tech
Wunmi has some measure of knowledge in the technical space. As a brand coordinator, she built websites for the business, having to create different pages for products, features and blog posts. She was able to accomplish all these as a self taught learner.
Every now and then, she does basic things especially with no code tools. She also adds that tech has greatly impacted her business because it has helped to get African brands and products to a lot more people. It has also allowed the startup to create economic empowerment in the fashion industry.
On the fashion scene in Africa, Wunmi is excited for the future and believes that African fashion is here to stay. 
‘I think it is exciting and I am excited to be a part of it. There is so much talent in brands and designers. Everyone is looking to African fashion and brands for inspiration already. One thing about African fashion is that it is here to stay and different from what is available on the global market.’

Nnenna Ajanwachukwu is trying to solve the problem of financial inclusion and she preaches collaboration	"Nnenna Ajanwachukwu has over 15 years experience cutting across financial services and payment industries, including consulting experience. 
She moved with her family to South Africa at 11, lived and studied in Pretoria, and started her career in South Africa (2005) in business development and marketing. 


Nnenna, like many Nigerians, who stay away from the country for a long time, had this longing to return home and do her part in nation-building. So, she returned to Nigeria and began her banking career. Her experience in the banking industry spans economic analysis, market and risk management, treasury, assets and liability management. 
She has a Master’s Degree in Economics from the University of Venda in South Africa and a Bachelor’s (Hons) Degree in Economics from the University of Pretoria in South Africa.
We had an interesting chat you should read. 
Making the pivot to tech
After working in the traditional banking sector for some years, Nnenna made the switch from the banking sector to the fintech space in 2018, working as the Business Development Manager, Transport Solutions, Industry Ecosystems at InterSwitch (one of the largest payment and switching companies in Nigeria). Like many growth enthusiasts, she wanted fresh air in a different field. 
Her experience in the technology innovation space cuts across market penetration strategies, business and product development, account management and financial modelling with a proven track record of sales and driving revenue growth in both B2B and B2C. 
Speaking on working in traditional banks and fintech, she believes both sectors are vastly different and only similar in a few cases. 
Read also: All you need to know about insider trading
“With the financial institutions, it used to be just normal traditional banking solutions, saving your money, providing loans and checks etc… What we do with fintech is that we look for areas where there are problems and develop solutions using technology. 
Fintechs use technology to drive changes and innovation in the banking sector, so, collaboration between traditional financial institutions and fintech companies should be a major headliner. Nnenna Ajanwachukwu
“We can already see a few collaborations as against what it was like ten years ago when I was in the banking sector, because fintech companies are helping banks do better at what they do by producing technological solutions.”
Nnenna believes fintech companies are providing real solutions to real problems as evidenced by the amount of funding that investors have been and continue to pour into the space.
“Anyone investing in a business must have done some due diligence to find out if the startups are producing or able to do what they say they will. An example is M-Pesa in Kenya, a fintech solution to inclusive banking. Many people still do not have bank accounts but they have phone numbers and with this, they can receive money.”
Nnenna Ajanwachukwu 
Nnenna believes the because the fintech space is vast and can accomodate as many ideas as possible, disagreeing that it is saturated.   
The fintech space is so large. We are talking about every sector and the attendant demographics. We are talking financial inclusion, women, payment in transport, education, oil & gas, logistics. Nnenna Ajanwachukwu
“There are too many problems to solve. Therefore, saying so many people coming in are not adding value wouldn’t be accurate because the market is so broad. You could build a fintech to provide solutions in oil and gas payments or a fintech to facilitate logistics or one for e-commerce allowing people to pay for products and services without stress. 
“We are talking about building platforms for ecosystems.”
What the Fintech space needs
Collaboration is what Nnenna preaches as opposed to competition, especially so as to share ideas and improve the workings of the tech ecosystem. 
She says that. “once there’s collaboration there will be seamlessness. When you build on what a company already has existing, it saves you time to focus on other things you need to do, rather than trying to build your stuff from the scratch.”
Let us aggregate the environment, let us digitise the sectors and work together not in competition. So, I think all the Fintechs should work together and create value not just for Nigeria but for Africa as well. Nnenna Ajanwachukwu
Challenges for Women in Fintech
As a woman in the Fintech space, Nnenna says gender is never a consideration for roles or benefits at Interswitch. Recall that Interswitch is the only Fintech company that made the list for the top 25 companies to work in and grow your career in Nigeria. 
However, she admits that gender disparity in the fintech space is a global phenomenon.
“What we see is glaring male dominance. Female leaders face a lot of challenges in this space, from more difficulty raising funds to many times being the only woman in a board room meeting with about ten men. I have also experienced this one time when I was on a panel of seven people and I was the only female on it. I remember thinking they should have balanced it with equal gender representation.”
Nnenna says the problem of representation may be because women do not show interest in STEM right from primary and secondary school. 
She believes that changing this at the root by encouraging more girls to go into STEM will increase the number of women available in the tech space. 
“While asking the question of equal representation, I realised that there are a few women who choose stem subjects in secondary schools or at the university. Majority of them go for social science courses while the males go for science and tech-related courses. 
“So, we need to encourage more young girls to take interest in these courses from primary school so that they are groomed to be in the stem world and maybe in the fintech space.” 
Nnenna adds that the gap can be closed when employers make intentional efforts to hire more women to correct the glaring gender gap in the Fintech space.
To create a balance, workplaces have to deliberately create a ratio of employment. Workplaces should create policies of inclusion to ensure that women and other marginalised people groups like the physically challenged and the others can be well represented in the space. Nnenna Ajanwachukwu
She buttressed this point using the system employed by the South African government to create a semblance of balance between the blacks and the whites after a long period of marginalisation by the whites. 
Since white South Africans had an unfair headstart in education and other factors, it became mandated that for every white employed a certain number of blacks must also be employed to balance out the ratio regardless of their level of education. 
Nnenna Ajanwachukwu 
The future
Does she have plans to be a founder? Nnenna says there is no need. 
“I currently run a business in the transport segment in InterSwitch and I am bound to collaborate with others to provide solutions. So, I am guaranteed a great career trajectory either in my current position or collaborating with others. 
“So, five years from now, I see myself building and developing inclusive solutions and models that would cater for the currently financially or technologically excluded. Nnenna Ajanwachukwu
“I also want to drive conversations, movements, bringing different stakeholders, policymakers, regulators, technology providers into the space. 
“I love public speaking, I love engaging with stakeholders in the industry, to bring them together to drive and harness what I call the Fintech boom in Nigeria and Africa. In that regard, I am currently studying for my PhD to understand the economics of financial innovations, so as to enable financial inclusion for the technologically excluded.”
Nnenna is not the one you should sleep on.

“Bringing value to the table makes you indispensable”- Toluwani Ijogun on being a woman in tech	"Toluwani Ijogun never really gave being in the tech space a thought, having worked in a number of market sectors, ranging from banking, FMCG, food and beverage and electronics. Now, she leads the team responsible for branding and communications at Nomba (the fintech company, formerly known as Kudi).
While she didn’t actively go seeking a job in the fintech space when she was approached for a position in a popular fintech brand, she said yes to exploring new vistas, that decision would mark the beginning of her foray into tech and her journey as a woman in tech.


How it started
Toluwani who earned a master’s in advertising had always wanted to work in a company where she could bring value to the table, a company that offered real value to the country and its customers and gave her room to grow she explains while talking about why she joined Nomba on her tech journey, 
“I was with Kuda Bank, another fintech for about 8 months after working in several sectors, I was approached by that fintech and was there before moving to Nomba where I work as the Vice President of communications. I was looking for a company where I could bring value to the table, a company that had a long-term strategy and was impacting and giving value to its customers. This is because, being in this field, a lot of fintech companies exist, really great ones but I wanted to be a company that would challenge me and one that had a strategy to not only impact its customers but its staff as well”. She said.
Having been at Nomba for 9 months, Toluwani seems to have found all she has been searching for at Nomba especially as she got the opportunity to lead the movement for the rebranding of the company formerly known as Kudi to Nomba. 
Bringing value to the table
Toluwani took up the challenge of rebranding the company formerly known as Kudi to Nomba because she loved challenges. And, she shares some insights into the hard work and strategy that went into that process.
 “I actually championed the rebranding from Kudi to Nomba because I felt our name was too close to another fintech in the country and people started mistaking us for that other company although we had been around for a lot longer. when I came on board, I realized the brand was ready to expand and make a lot of noise about things and it would really have been unfortunate to spend a lot of money on a brand that would be mistaken for another brand because we would only have been adding equity to that other band and not differentiate ourselves” she says.
Having an idea to rebrand would have just remained an idea if the management of the company didn’t approve of the idea, Toluwani had an idea and she not only got the management to approve but she also led strategies on how to come up with a new widely acceptable brand name that both management and customers alike could identify with. 
 “ I was very glad when the management agreed for us to change the name and I devised strategies to come up with the name Nomba.  I think the name is fantastic because it resonates with everyone especially in business because you know numbers are the life of your business it tells you if you are growing or dying and even in life it’s all about the numbers.  I feel like we have a fantastic name and built a fantastic brand, I believe we have something special”. 
The rebranding from Kudi to Nomba which was spearheaded by Toluwani went live on April 15th and she shares how the feedback and acceptance from customers have been so far. “ the feedback has been amazing” she says.  

“The feedback has been fantastic, people love the name and the brand and because we have already done quite a lot since our inception, it’s been very easy transitioning because with 150 businesses on our platform today, it has given us a brand that both staff and customers are proud of and willing to push to the next level.”
The experience from working in tech
Tolu who has worked in various industries before ‘stumbling into tech’, observes that tech is very different from other sectors for many reasons. 
“ Tech is a bit different from other sectors because it’s new young, dynamic, things are fast-paced and changing very quickly, lots of regulations, understanding the customers, a lot of competition, unlike other sectors in tech everybody has money so I’ve realised it’s not just about having money, it’s about strategy, product, positioning.”
Tolu said that tech has made her dive deeper into even relatively known terms in branding and marketing to create a brand that resonates with everybody. This is because tech is unlike familiar spaces at least yet. “Like the name Nomba, we had to look for a name that anyone anywhere could understand”, she said.
Tolu summarises her learning curve ever since thus:
“Tech, in general, has pushed me to be more deliberate and strategic in the things we do, how we put out communication, the ads we do and how we constantly keep a pulse on what our customers need to create value for them”
Challenges as a woman in tech
Toluwani believes in bringing value to whatever table she is sitting at regardless of her gender. She talks about how being a woman in tech has been interesting and what has helped her navigate male-dominated spaces be it oil& gas, tech and others.
“ What has worked for me is being good at your job and being consistent. I think the one thing that makes a woman stand out regardless of the industry is being good at what she does and her ability to bring value to the table. I think that has really given me an edge because I am good at what I do and I always want to be challenged, I always want to do better so when I am sitting at a table, I am sitting like someone with experience who is bringing value to the table.“ She says.
She elucidates that she doesn’t believe that there is any problem peculiar to tech, stating that it is almost like a people problem, or a company culture challenge not necessarily a problem with the tech space.
“ I have worked in different categories, with different personalities, I don’t really think it is a tech problem, I think it’s the people you work with, the company culture, the person you report to so I won’t say its a tech thing, it’s the company, the culture and how you fit in it”.

Advice to women in tech
For women looking to pivot into tech, Toluwani has this advice for you;
“ Nothing is too big and nothing is impossible, I think women look at it and say oh my God tech, I can’t get it, no you can just apply! I think what is important is being good and consistent at what you do. For me I didn’t even apply, I was approached. Just make your work visible and apply to any company you are interested in, the worst they can get is a no but what if you get a yes?”.
“Do not be intimidated by any company, just apply and be sure you add value because the tech space is very dynamic and fast-paced so companies are always looking for talents who know what they are doing and can add value to their work. So long as you know what you can offer, please go ahead, and send that message on LinkedIn, apply! apply! apply!”, she adds.

Comparitech Report: Nigeria’s SIM Card Registration Laws Don’t Protect Privacy	"Since it was initiated by the NCC at the beginning of the last decade, SIM registration has been an on-going exercise in Nigeria. Subscribers are required to provide their biodata and biometrics for the process.
However, a recent report by Comparitech has described Nigeria’s SIM card registration laws as “invasive” and ranked it among the worst in the world.



SIM registration in Nigeria among most invasive in the world https://t.co/2uugCUxhsU via @FinancialNG— Martins Hile (@martinshile) January 9, 2020

The Comparitech report considered a number of factors before arriving at its damning conclusion. These factors include biometrics requirement, duration of data storage, who it is stored with, accessibility of the data to law enforcement and data privacy legislation protecting the collected information. 
After these considerations, the report ranks Nigeria together with Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Myanmar, Tajikistan and United Arab Emirates as countries where privacy under SIM card registration is not protected. 
First, biometrics (fingerprints and facial scans) are required during the registration process, and data is stored with the NCC who holds the data for 3 years. During this period, the information can be shared with security agencies on request without informing the subscriber. 

https://twitter.com/mlnangalama/status/1215655676413800448

 Nigeria also has strict laws for those who default the process, with punishment ranging from 200,000 Naira fine to prison sentences. All of these raise serious privacy concerns. 
“Creating a database of citizens and their mobile numbers restricts private communications, increases the potential of them being tracked and monitored, enables governments to build in-depth profiles of their citizens, and risks private data falling into the wrong hands.”Comparitech
According to the report, “authorities could selectively throttle, censor, or block internet connections of specific people or groups of people, giving way for harassment and persecution.”
In recent times, there has been a rise in internet censorship by African governments as well as intimidation of opposition critics and rights campaigners. 

And in the case where there’s a paucity of data legislation, subscriber information could be provided to third parties including advertisers and government agencies without the owner’s consent.
There’s an alarming surge in spam calls and messages received by SIM card subscribers in Nigeria. There’s also the curious detainment of a Nigerian by the Department of State Services over the purchase and use of an MTN SIM card previously used by the President’s daughter. All these raise questions about the implementation of the 2019 Nigeria Data Protection Regulation by NITDA.
How seriously do Nigerians take their privacy? 
There’s also the valid question of whether Nigerians care about their privacy enough to be worried. Receiving unsolicited messages has become pretty normal and nobody is really trying to stop it. 
For some folks, the loss of an old SIM card means an opportunity to buy a new one. Thus, legally, they just gave the NCC 3 fresh years to hold on to their personal information as provided upon a new SIM card registration. 
Furthermore, many Nigerians willingly sign up for services on the internet, filling in vital data, without reading their terms and conditions. In the end, such data could be harvested and sold to 3rd parties.
Nevertheless, the issue of SIM card registration still needs to be discussed and proper measures implemented to protect subscriber’s data from every third party including government and its agencies.

“Women in Tech are Overmentored and Underfunded” – Clara Okoro, Founder, My Beautiful Africa	"For a woman who likes travelling, having a foreigner compliment her Ankara dress and ask to buy it off of her after a conference was a watershed for Clara Okoro. That singular experience inspired her to build a traveltech startup called My Beautiful Africa where people get to experience Africa in a whole new light with help from tech.
I was wearing a Kaftan that I designed and made and a lot of people were engrossed with it because of the beautiful way it portrayed Africa’s heritage.

Clara Okoro
It is not a secret that gender bias still comes into play concerning the business-building efforts of women in the tech space. A number of initiatives have been put into place to help get more women into the tech space and to a large extent, they are providing positive results. 
However, an imbalance still exists between getting women into tech and actually enabling them to build strong startups. In a nutshell, women are increasingly over-mentored and under-funded. Clara Okoro discussed this challenge and ways of getting around it in a virtual interview with TechNext. 
Clara OkoroFounder, My Beautiful Africa
Our patriarchal culture is still at play in the business sector
Women are being empowered like never before and as such, there is no reason for anyone to sit back and stay away from the action in the tech space. Despite the mentoring and the push being provided, getting timely access to funding in order to grow the business still remains a challenge. 
While more grants and investment opportunities are available to women-led businesses, the chances of male-led businesses being supported are much higher
Suggested Read: Women in Tech: Lola Ekugo Talks About Building Industry Ties and Upskilling Outside the Workspace
For instance, out of 10 startups that have been funded by Microtraction, a VC firm in Nigeria, 5 have all-male founders while another 5 has 1 female each as a cofounder and the other co-founders are men. There is no solely female-led tech startup in the mix even though there are a number of startups founded and led by women that evidently funding support for their businesses to grow and be able to stand on its own.
In 2020, women-led businesses raised even less funding in the African-tech sector than in recent years. Only 3.2% of the total monies raised within that period were raised by female-led startups while the remaining 96.8% was raised by male-led startups. Less than 5% of total funding was raised by women-led startups globally.

One of the reasons for this is that women do not pursue funding as aggressively as their male counterparts. 
“As women, sometimes we don’t pursue things because we don’t want to be seen as pushy or as aggressive but the world has shifted. It’s not about being bossy, it is about laying out your solution in a way that the world knows that it needs it. Stand up for yourself and speak convincingly to investors and anyone who has anything to contribute to your business,” she finished.Clara Okoro
“From my experience, I know that bank officials can look at the portfolio of a woman running into millions of Naira and still question her ability to run the business even though she is presenting a solid plan for the loan being requested. That has been enough to stop a number of women from pursuing funding necessary to execute ideas that have potential,” she said.
Due to this disparity, women need to become more aggressive about applying for loans, grants, investments and other funding opportunities that are available. Women equally need to generate funding from doing business with other companies.

Relationships also come into play a lot in the tech space and women entrepreneurs are not favoured by certain aspects. Male entrepreneurs that have been in business for a while for instance, have a way of meeting up with themselves and talking business in ways that the women counterparts do not. 
“We come from a background of patriarchy and even in the business world, men form these cliques that are hard for women to break into,” Clara said.
Male entrepreneurs are the ones in the clubs at night hanging out, discussing businesses and clinching deals while women stay at home and out of the conversation.
These cliques feed the gender bias and make it harder for women techies or tech bros if you like, and women-led businesses to get jobs based on merit and skill alone. If established businesses and agencies have policies that advocate for women-led businesses to get projects and deals based on skill and merit, more of these startups will find it easier to get funding by rendering services on a larger scale. 
There are opportunities for women in the tech space, as much as for men. Initiatives like She Hacks Africa, She Leads Africa, The Stem Belle and Oreoluwa Lesi’s WTec are doing a lot to encourage young girls and women to enter into the different fields in tech. Increasingly, more women are doing that. However, besides having mentors, women need access to more funding so that the hustle can be balanced on both sides.

Early-stage investor, Elizabeth Pambuka talks about how women-led startups can attract angel investments	"Access to funding is a very critical need for early-stage startups. Funding is required for product development, marketing efforts, operations and sustaining the startup’s team. 
On the African startup scene, venture capital deals are more often the order of the day. However, there is the other option of Angel Investment.


TechNext spoke with Elizabeth Pambuka, the Managing Partner at ThandInvest. She also recently became the Vice President of Growth of Pickmeup, a Nigerian ride-hailing startup, and sits on its board. From her base in Kuala Lumpur, she works with investors in Asia and Africa to help female-led startups get funding from the right investors. 
Elizabeth Pambuka
Hardly does a week go by in Africa without at least three startups on the continent attracting some amount of funding. It has not always been like this though. Some 10 years ago, the Paystack’s, Flutterwave’s and Andela’s were not in existence and funding inflow into startups was at its nascent stage. 
The local funding landscape on the continent is still relatively young and has only a few angel networks sparsely distributed across it. In Nigeria, one of the more prominent angel networks is the Lagos Angel Network (LAN). 
One of the core differences between the VC investors and Angel investors is that the latter will heavily bring in mentoring and advisory help to the startup while the former mostly brings in the funding only. For a startup at the very early stages, getting funding and advisory from an angel investor is a better option because of the more favourable conditions. 
Portrait of a beautiful smiling afro American woman holding money isolated on a gray background
“Angel investors, are usually described as risk-takers as they are not afraid to invest in the highly volatile stages of a startup. Although venture capitalists will require a board seat at the startup table, they will generally not act as mentors,” Pambuka shared.
She added that another difference is that funding from VC is usually gathered from different sources. The difference between VC funding and angel investment is the money used to invest and how it affects the investment terms. Angel investors are investing their own money while VC funding is money invested from pooled funds.
Funding is still unbalanced between male-led startups and female-led startups. Recent data show that fewer women entrepreneurs get funding compared to their male counterparts. Another study in the US shows that an increase in the number of women angel investors led to a corresponding increase in the number of women-led businesses that were funded. 
This indicates that a way for more viable women-led businesses to receive angel funding is to have more angel investors who are women in the network of investors. “African female tech founders require this kind of support in the early stages to ensure success and growth for the next stage and funding round,” Pambuka added.
How women-led businesses can attract more angel investment
In Pambuka’s experience from analyzing pitch decks for different startups and managing funding programs for startups, angel investors, as well as VC investors, usually pick a business based on the team, the availability of a minimum viable product. In this regard, angel investors are not much different from VC investors.
They do not only invest in the business, they fundamentally invest in the people behind the idea. In the tech industry, one needs to have a minimal viable product. Pambuka added, “If your idea has not been tested for the market, you add another layer to the risks involved in funding early-stage startups.” 
A tested product or technology will lower the barriers to market entry. Taking the product through market adoption testing will look at how well it will perform in the market against possible competition and provide more information that potential investors can draw insights from. A minimum viable product (MVP) will also demonstrate an exit possibility for early investors. 
Elizabeth Pambuka
Networking
Getting investors to notice and take interest in a startup begins by making a connection with them. This is where networking comes in for women entrepreneurs especially. 
Going to clubs and hanging out with other business people is something that comes more easily for male entrepreneurs than for their female counterparts. But women startup leaders need to do more of it.

Therefore, it is essential for women entrepreneurs to deliberately create and work with a plan that puts them in constant interaction with potential investors and partners for their businesses. 
As Pambuka puts it, “In an environment where visibility of startups is generally low, the first thing I would encourage female founders to do is to be more aggressive in their networking. This is simply because that is the only way you will have access to potential investors.”
Returns on investment
Contrary to the opinion that angel investors only look at the entrepreneur alone when selecting, they are also just as invested in ensuring a return on their investment as VC investors. However, the mentorship, strategic advice and support largely given by angel investors is crucial to the success of early-stage startups who receive these investments.
The mentorship and coaching will increase the chances of success of these startups and reduce the risk of losing capital as well as return on investment for the investors.

Women In Tech- 9ijakids Founder Titilope Adewusi  Talks About Tech as an Enabler and the Value of Early Exposure	"“When the pieces are on the floor, you can’t really make sense of it, but when it all comes together, we see the need for some of what has happened. Ultimately, we are a sum total of our experiences.” This was how my interview with Titilope Adewusi, founder of 9ijakids started.
One of 7 siblings and a mechanical engineer, her journey into business started from working with banks and multinationals in the country. She worked with the now-defunct Gulf Bank and later joined Arthur Andersen (now KPMG).


Titilope Adewusi
After about 11 years with KPMG, she felt the need to identify her passion and build a business around it. Stepping out of KPMG took Titilope directly to The Place. In her perspective, tech is an enabler that is best combined with experience.    
“Working with KPMG afforded me the opportunity to work with different companies from telecommunications to oil and gas. Starting from that place of learning about different sectors, business challenges prepared me for when I followed my passion,” she said.

Exposure opens you up to better ways of doing things
Moving from KPMG to The Place was a reinforcement of the fact that good business relationships can bring opportunities in the future as it was her former boss at KPMG, Kola Adewale who asked her to join him on the management team of the restaurant. The Place had only one branch at Ikeja, at the time.
“I found out that the business principles used in KPMG were also operable in other sectors. Every business is about customers. We did not just add certain foods to the menu because of their popularity, we looked at who our customers were and brought offerings based on their peculiarities.”
The Place
Keeping an eye on the financial numbers of the business and never forgetting that location is where marketing starts for a food company, Titi and The Place team soon expanded from 1 to 14 branches in Lagos. 
Soon after, Titi says she realized that this was meant to be a passing phase for her to figure out what her passion is. She found out that she’s passionate about learning and helping others learn in a fun and effective manner.
Pivoting into edtech
9ijakids was cofounded by Titilope and 2 of her siblings, Yeside Ogunremi and Dayo Amusu. The idea for the company came about when she found out that one of her own children who loved playing games did not enjoy learning, and would always postpone reading and other learning activities.

“He hated anything textbooks, but if schoolwork was presented in the form of games, he took to it and did not get tired of playing the game,” she said.
Survey showed that it was the same story with a lot of children and from there, she began looking for ways to enable this kind of fun and engaging learning for kids. This was how 9ijakids was established.
A web and mobile app has been developed to make it more accessible to children. School concepts and topics are broken down and repackaged into games that children can play and remember.

School subjects aren’t the only things taught with 9ijakids games as the ability to create games children respond to is being used to teach entrepreneurship, financial literacy and Nigerian values to the young audience.
Making passion profitable
Because kids are the primary focus of the company’s edtech products, parents and schools remain the fastest and logical way to bring 9ijakids to them. There was reluctance from some schools at first because of slow adaptation to technology and the comfort that comes from doing things the old and familiar way. 
But COVID-19 has forced parents and schools to rapidly embrace new ways of doing things. Titi says that has helped more people to see the opportunities that kids can have when their learning is blended with content from 9ijakids. 
It costs N500 to learn with the edtech company’s resources for 6 months, and schools have the option of paying per term. For Titi and her team, the model hinges on volume and affordability. 
“We want this fun way of learning to be affordable for a huge number of kids in and outside Nigeria,” she says.
Drawing from her own unique story and work experience, Titi says that some of what she finds indispensable to building a business includes constantly researching and getting feedback. “It puts the business, whatever it is, on a customer-driven path. The more you deal with customers, the more they tell you their problems and that could lead to your next round of products.”
Her edtech company also operates in the UK. And by listening to the customers in that part of the world, she saw a need to make the company’s animated books available for people to get for their kids on Amazon. 
Leveraging technology is a way of doing things for Titi, as she says, it is not something that is complicated and only for the eggheads. It is as simple and practical as using POS or a payment gateway online for more customers to be able to access your products.
“It could also just require that you make use of apps that make it easy for people to find and order for your products online, or dispatch them to customers,” she says.
Titi’s story can be described in one word; exposure. Being exposed to different company practices, and challenges, as well as brainstorming ways to solve them, has helped provide an elevated view for building her own company.

Symbiotic Relationships are Needed to Enhance Femtech Innovations – Abisola Oladapo, MumSpring Founder	"The attention on fintech and the crypto space right now overshadows the work of techpreneurs in other subsectors especially the femtech sector. Frost and Sullivan estimates that the global femtech sector will be worth $50 billion by 2025 and $60 billion by the year 2027. This means that there is a lot of potential and possibilities to look out for in the space.
Femtech was coined in 2016 by Ida Tin, a Danish author and CEO of the women’s menstruation-tracking app, Clue. Her aim was to bring more focus to technology that caters directly to women’s health. The femtech space covers startups that develop period and fertility trackers, pregnancy and neonatal care, diagnostics, digital products, and other services that use technology to focus on women’s health. 


Unfortunately, the percentage of women techpreneurs innovating in this space is very small globally and even smaller in Africa. This is mostly because tech has a small pool of women, to begin with, and from that pool, very few venture into the femtech subsector.
In this edition of Women in Tech, the founder of MumSpring, Abisola Oladapo discusses the need for more women innovators in the femtech space. With 99.13 million women in Nigeria, there is a present market for femtech startups. But one factor that prevents more women from operating in the space is the need to feel overqualified as a techpreneur.
MumSpring is a femtech startup that provides ante-natal information to low-income women and gives 24/7 access to certified midwives without requiring internet connection or airtime.
As Abisola puts it, “for most of us as women, we feel we need to have a thorough knowledge of the code, the tech and how it is going to come together to solve the challenge.
“We are able to relate to the problem because we are familiar with the challenges to female health being females ourselves. Where we stop is at the point of asking, ‘how can I use tech to solve this problem?'”
Abisola OladapoFounder, MumSpring 
Creating a product brings in a variety of skills and it is no different in the femtech space. Women are indispensable in this space because of the invaluable insights that only they can give by virtue of their biological makeup. However, it is not compulsory for women to have the technical skills required to develop the product itself, except they are inclined towards that.
Coding and other technical skills should not deter us as women from innovating in the femtech space when we come across problems that we can solve for a large number of other women. 
A graduate of Electrical Engineering herself, Abisola stresses that more girls need to be encouraged to take STEM-related courses and consider careers in tech. Yet she concedes that they “don’t have to be the one who builds the tech, you just have to be willing to work with someone else.” 
Like MumSpring, Whispa, Nabta and Grace Health, femtech startups are able to innovate more effectively with more women fueling the ideation process.
“It is a symbiotic relationship between me and my CTO at MumSpring. Without my deep insights and connection with other women who help us to understand what they are going through, he is not able to create a product for mothers and without his deep technical know-how, it might take me a while longer,” she added.

Another reason more women are not venturing into femtech is that it focuses only on one gender. Most people would rather build a product or innovate for both genders than to focus on only one. However, contrary to what most people think when they hear ‘femtech‘, it is not limited to just period tracking apps, ovulation monitors or sex education apps. More innovations are coming up in the areas of fertility, female hygiene, breast and cervical cancers and a lot more.
Women have long been uncomfortable talking about female health challenges for fear of being stigmatized, among other things. This has made apps like Whispa that offer anonymous sex and health advice as well as medical consultations for women to be popular. All of this together points to the fact that more women and girls are embracing femtech solutions that address the challenges that we face but do not publicly talk about.
A different approach is needed for getting investors to fund femtech startups
Unlike fintech, edtech and other sectors, the femtech space caters mostly to women alone. Its gender-specific nature means that products can only be marketed, purchased and consumed by women and this streamlines the market. However, because of the huge population of women and the personal nature of the solutions, femtech is very much a viable space.

Getting investments for femtech startups then is about finding the right type of investor. As a techpreneur in the space, Abisola said it is about finding the right fit as there are investors that are very much interested in and focus on solutions built for women.
“If you are talking to the right kind of investor, you will find that they will even be the ones telling you how to get more women on board for your product,” she said.
In getting the right kind of investors, it is necessary to look for people who understand the space and would not consider femtech a big jump for them. Other women in the ecosystem are likely to be more willing to invest in femtech startups as well. Sharing from her experience with MumSpring, Abisola said, “a lot of women either in the investment space or in the ecosystem are really excited about us innovating for women and have opened doors for us.”
She noted that the gender-specific nature of MumSpring hasn’t been a red flag for investors but has instead, caused more attention to be placed on finding more ways to use technology to solve female-specific problems.

For women innovators in the space to attract more investor interest, it is important to not just see the problem but to also see how technology can be used to solve it and how that solution can be scaled increasingly over time.
As the femtech space evolves, the future of startups in the space will depend on their ability to grow with the woman, solve the problems she has as a youth with regular periods, as a pregnant woman, as a mom and as a growing adult. Being able to do this and do it well will help women in tech tap into the $50 billion-worth femtech sector.

How Losode’s Aderonke Ajose-Adeyemi wants to become the queen of e-commerce in Sub-Saharan Africa	"The founder and CEO of e-commerce company, Losode, Aderonke Ajose-Adeyemi, believes that women do not have to struggle so much to play in the tech space. Speaking with Onyinye Okonkwo of Technext about the challenges of being a female founder in the Nigerian tech ecosystem, she said it’s important that women do not think less of themselves. 
“I don’t really see myself as a woman. Of course, I am a full woman, however, if I’m sitting with a male founder it doesn’t even cross my mind to think less of myself. I believe if you work hard, if you prove yourself, if you get the right team, externally and internally, if you make a compelling argument, you will get where you are going. I am not one who believes I should be rewarded if I do not do the work.“ 


Ade, as she is used to being called, is the founder of Losode, an “e-commerce online marketplace which enables trade for four groups of people which are: people who want to sell in Nigeria and Africa, those who want to sell outside Africa, those who are outside but are looking to break into the African market, and people who want to buy from all of the above. It gives local access, global access, and two-way international access.”
Ade is a qualified engineer which perhaps prepared her for venturing into the tech space. She holds a Bachelor of Engineering (BE), in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the Queen Mary University of London. She also has a certificate in Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneurial Studies from the London Business School. She has worked with multinational companies like KPMG, Thomson Reuters, Credit Suisse, MS Amlin, etc, across Europe. 
So, how does an Engineer with such a level of experience pivot into being the founder and C.E.O of a technology company that facilitates e-commerce you may ask?

As she tells it, the idea for Losode came after a highly disappointing shopping experience in 2010. She had gone all around Lagos, from Victoria Island as far as Ogba, Ikeja, armed with the Naira equivalent of about 500 pounds, looking for quality clothes and a shopping experience. Ade mentions she couldn’t find anything she wanted and ended up buying out of fashion clothes she didn’t believe would give her her money’s worth. 
 It was the worst shopping day of my life.
Having lived in the UK and occasionally visiting Nigeria, she couldn’t believe how the structure for trade and commerce was almost nonexistent in Nigeria and in Africa. This is where she saw the opportunity.

After that realisation, Ade went ahead to create a platform that would make it easy for people to have access to high-quality fashion. For her, “it’s really about creating access, where can I access what I want. We are solving two problems at a time because the infrastructure doesn’t exist for trade and commerce. Our trade network just isn’t working”. 
She is very passionate about creating infrastructure for trade and commerce, believing having solid trade and commerce structures in place will regulate trade in Nigeria since the buyers have already responded in a certain way. According to engineer turned ‘tech sis’, this is the real vision of Losode.
I am not a cloth or fashion seller. I don’t have clothing items that I sell. What I have is a platform that brings people together. So I’m not really focused on clothing, I am interested in the industry. 
When she first started, she confesses that she wasn’t proud to tell people what she did. 
“How do I tell people I sell clothes online? Especially as an engineer, I expected I would be somewhere around that field so I had a problem being honest with people because It sounded absurd. But, I’m glad I started anyway because as I continued I gained clarity”. 
She gained clarity in her entrepreneurial journey, has faced a few challenges and learnt some lessons. 

Lessons and challenges
One of the lessons Ade has learned is that you need to keep updating yourself with market trends. This is besides the fact that she has learned to make mental shifts from thinking like an employee to an employer. 
One of the major challenges for anyone in tech is raising funds but it has been argued to be more of a challenge for women in tech in Africa. Ade doesn’t dwell on this so much as she believes that “it is difficult to raise funds anywhere you are in the world. I don’t think it’s just in Nigeria. It does help if you have a more mature ecosystem, but like in Nigeria, you have less competition. Nobody will give you money because you look pretty, no one will give you money unless you do the actual work.”
One key challenge Ade has is the lack of expertise in the talent pool – finding the right team and the right people. 
There is some expertise we can’t find in Nigeria and I have to do some jobs myself because I am the only one who can properly get some things done, which keeps me from fully focusing on my role as CEO. But, it’s ok because we are still building and I hope we can move out of that and get the right people.Aderonke Ajose
Regardless of the challenges, Ade believes that “the argument for the challenges is what calls for entrepreneurial intervention. There is still so much to be done in putting these infrastructures in place in Nigeria and the African continent. There are institutional voids like lack of regulation, lack of infrastructure, and corruption. The government cannot solve all these problems alone, which is what makes it necessary for entrepreneurs to intervene by coming up with solutions to these problems. So yes, it’s been challenging but it’s exciting because we have been able to turn our challenges into power.”

Future of the Losode vision 
Losode emerged in the top three positions on the leaderboard at a 2016 competition by the Richard Branson-led Virgin Media business pitch competition, and since then has continued to be a preeminent fashion destination in Africa. 
Speaking on future aspirations, Ade says that in ten years she would personally like to become the queen of e-commerce. 
She hopes to be able to create a massive impact in people’s lives that would be disruptive. She believes that Losode would be successful for her if they can change people’s lives, and create the infrastructure that would disrupt the way trade and commerce are currently being run in Africa. 
“We haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of e-commerce in Africa. So, in ten years, I see us operational in all 45 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Not just going there but building infrastructures for trade including empowering the players, and becoming something like a gatekeeper of trade. 
“When we look at the vision we see fintech in Losode pay, hopefully, with our own switch, we see media, with fashions news, fashion TV, we see logistics, having a huge fleet across Africa, there’s edutech, packaging, warehousing, doing luxury and retail, kids. There is so much we can do.”
Losode is a gift that just keeps on giving. We want to create more jobs, impact the GDP and just make a great impact. Aderonke Ajose
What’s the unique selling point? 
Losode is an e-commerce platform and a growth engine for small businesses. Beyond driving trade and commerce, the platform provides powerful growth tools that make it easier for businesses to scale and maximise local and global sales opportunities. They aim to incubate and accelerate the growth of brands on their platform and equip them to be agents of change in their various communities. 
The all-female founding team of Losode has almost 40 years of combined experience across management consulting and a wide range of technology sectors. It is this experience that they bring to deliver a robust and effective platform that can facilitate the opportunity they believe is ripe for the taking.
Women in Tech 
Tech is everywhere around us. So long as you use a mobile phone or any technology-enabled device. Tech is not this technical phenomenon we like to think it is. Of course, there is a very technical and complex side to tech but that isn’t all there is to it. 
Ade believes that this notion that tech is complex, technical, and manly may be the reason many women are not yet venturing into the tech space. 
“What is tech? If you are trying to make your hair for example and you discover that there is a problem getting a hair maker and you decided to build an app to connect hair makers all over, you’re in tech.
Tech doesn’t do anything different, all it can do is take what you already do and make it quicker, bigger and boundaryless.
Specifically, to women, she encouraged them to be bold. 
“One thing I’ll tell women is to be bold and courageous. Notice I didn’t say act boldly, because there is a difference. Being bold is a very serious charge. So, be bold in learning about your space, equip yourself, and know what you are talking about so that when you step out you’re bold. 
“A lot of people are like ‘fake it till you make it’ and maybe that may work to a certain degree but when you are bold with substance, you are called up because you have something knowledgeable and substantial to deliver. And, when you do decide to run, make it big, don’t be quiet about it, don’t shrink yourself, let your light shine for the world to see.“

Major Takeaways from ‘Women in Tech’ With Forbes Fellow, Andrea Kamara Dunbar, Founder of BalanceBowl	"Hi there! Guess what? Yes, we started a show!
‘Women in Tech’ is our way of identifying women who are making an impact in the tech sector, bringing to the forefront what they are doing, and helping others who want to follow in their footsteps.


My quest for this cadre of women led me to Andrea Kamara Dunbar. Quite an impressive lady, Andrea is the Founder of a chain of businesses spread across different sectors of the economy. She’s also a Forbes Fellow.

An infectious smile across her face as she entered our offices on a beautiful Wednesday afternoon, she struck me as a relatable businesswoman who has amassed quite a level of experience from her activities across sectors and the confidence that comes with it.
She shared with me her journey, from how she started to growing her businesses and when she finally decided to expand to other countries.
When mom gives you a job application when all you asked for was some money…
Andrea’s foray into business started at the age of 14 when she requested some money from her mom to buy some shoes but got a job application for her troubles. According to her, that helped her to be more independent and develop a ‘tough skin’ when it came to work.
Andrea Kamara Dunbar
This part of her background has played a key role in shaping how she does business.
I started working at 14 in a restaurant. I remember I wanted some particular shoes, and I asked my mother for the money and, she came home with a job application. She said, “if you want these shoes, go and work for them”.  I was upset at the time, but I am actually happy now that she gave me that job application.Andrea Kamara Dunbar
That basically started Andrea’s journey into business. From working as a cleaner, Andrea rose through the ranks to become a hostess. Then she became a waitress, a bartender and an events coordinator.
From bartending, here are some businesses Andrea has founded and how she runs them
In 2011, Andrea Kamara Dunbar started Broad Street International as an event planning enterprise. The company later pivoted into Customer Service Training for hotels, restaurants, government institutions and staff,  leveraging a lot on her food background.
The consultancy company (BSI) started in Washington DC as Andrea’s senior project while she was a student. Here is a fun fact: Andrea likes food! 
In 2015, I worked with a Real Estate firm and I received commission for each unit I sold. Instead of taking my commission in cash, I took in form of the ground floor of the building and set up a restaurant there and it’s been there since.Andrea Kamara Dunbar
After running Broad Street International for a while, she started Broad Street Cafe, and then decided to bring tech into the mix, with Balance Bowl.
Balance Bowl is a tech-enabled healthy food company that focuses on helping people achieve their health goals with the appropriate diet. The foodtech startup began in Liberia in 2018.
Balance Bowl took off from Andrea’s efforts to be more deliberate about eating and shedding some weight. After pinning some food pictures on Pinterest, she started getting orders from friends for a bowl or two. After seeing the potential in it, she launched it as a full-time business.
“After I sent a bowl of food to my friend’s office, her boss tasted out of it and liked it, so the next day, I sent two bowls, and then three bowls, and then four bowls.”Andrea Kamara Dunbar
Realizing that tech could  help her reach more people, as well as enable her to bring in other valuable services as part of the Balance Bowl offering, Andrea began the process of building a mobile application. However, it was not an easy task.
“There are quite a number of people here, but finding people that want to do the job with integrity has been quite challenging. I have to rebuild the app three times in the process”Andrea Kamara Dunbar
Using artificial intelligence, and machine learning, the app will make it easy for people to locate restaurants where they can get healthy food near them. They can also pay and get their orders delivered in a relatively short period of time.
Andrea Kamara Dunbar
Besides ordering food on the Balance Bowl app, people will be able to talk to a virtual dietician on the platform. Customers with health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, etc, can speak with the virtual dietician who will help them plan meals and choose a BalanceBowl plan that is the best for their health.
Putting the health needs of customers at the forefront, Andrea Kamara Dunbar leaves no stone unturned. Through the app, users can buy health supplements to ensure they are getting the maximum nutrients needed to stay healthy.

If you like cooking healthy foods but don’t know how, the app provides recipe videos to help you replicate healthy dishes in the comfort of your own home.
“Balance Bowl is already established in Liberia, so I decided to expand to Nigeria because there is a large number of tech-savvy young people and the population is much more. But I realize that food is not a problem in Nigeria, there are many restaurants already, so I decided to offer a food solution that would enable people manage their health from their phone; the Balance Bowl app.”Andrea Kamara Dunbar
Currently, the food-tech company operates in Lagos and has plans of scaling to other states in Nigeria, before expanding to Accra and Kigali.
Women development
Besides her work in Balance Bowl, Andrea Kamara Dunbar considers herself a Rural development entrepreneur who is passionate about helping rural women become more entrepreneurial and develop their skills and capabilities.
She started Quintessential Business Women Association (QBWA) in Liberia, after she had volunteered with the QBWA in Nigeria. In Liberia, Andrea works with her team to empower women in the agricultural sector by providing help with packaging, market access, finance among others.
Part of what Andrea and the QBWA team do is also to help the women become bankable. They also provide them the right structures in place for their businesses so that they can approach banks and other organizations if they need funding or other relevant resources.
Yea, she was rejected by Forbes then what?
When Forbes called for application to be recognized as one of Forbes under 30 women making impact, Andrea sent in an application. After a long process, her application was rejected and the list came out without her name on it.
“I was hurt, and I was hurt so much more because they made me work so much. It was months and months of back and forth between the people that applied and the editors; interviews, clearance, photo shoots and all the other due diligence that was involved. But I learnt a lot, when you have to tell your story that many times, you start to find ways that you can use that to impact other people.”Andrea Kamara Dunbar
According to her, that took a lot out of her but she did not let it weigh her down. Interestingly, Forbes Women had taken notice of her and they invited her to the first global summit that took place in Israel.
Networking with other high-achieving women and getting some more exposure were the highlights of the summit for Andrea and it helped to reaffirm to her that limits are meant to be stretched.
“The biggest takeaway for me was the networking I got to do. Sitting in a room with Fortune 500 CEOs, entrepreneurs, investors, politicians and others from all over the world was just powerful. We are friends now, because of the networking at the summit.”Andrea Kamara Dunbar
Balancing more than one major role is quite tricky. It is however necessary as women rise higher in the ranks to take on more complex roles in society. 
With the launch of the BalanceBowl app and expansion of its operations, Andrea is just starting to chip at the edges of more responsibility and success, which is what women in tech do.

‘Women in tech should make themselves heard’- Zenithchain’s Vivian Agbata talks about visibility for women	"It is a well-known fact that women are underrepresented in the global tech space. While more and more women are starting to build tech careers in a male-dominated field, women, nonetheless, do not get as much visibility as their male counterparts due to this underrepresentation.
For Vivian Agbata, being the Public Relations Officer of Zenithchain, a blockchain company, means she constantly has to make herself heard in places where conversations are steered by men. And in a video session with Tech Next’s Women in Tech series, she revealed that her journey into tech is a story of finding herself through grit and determination.


The Lagos-born graduate of Economics from the University of Port-Harcourt came back to base to hustle and get started with life. After a series of jobs in marketing, promotional and merchandising jobs, she made a decision to seek a career path in tech. 
Her interest in tech stemmed from her undergraduate days when she watched her male friends code but felt it was something she couldn’t do. But she eventually decided to set her mind to it and with her background knowledge as an economist, she secured a job as a financial analyst with Zenithchain, a blockchain startup.
“I really wanted a change of career, to go into something sustainable that I know won’t wear off in the future. I decided to focus on tech because it’s the future. With prior knowledge of finance, while studying economics, I thought it would be interesting to go into fintech. It gave me direction on what I want to do in the tech industry.”Vivian Agbata, PRO Zenithchain
Her decision to venture into tech meant going back to acquire technical knowledge. This led her to the National Institute of Information Technology where she studied Management Information Systems. While working as a financial analyst, the company recognized her immense talent as a marketer and then made her the Public Relations Officer.
A unicorn in the blockchain industry 
Vivian Agbata, Financial Analyst and PRO at Zenith Chain
Blockchain technology is one of the most notable developments of our age. There are endless possibilities accessible on the blockchain which includes cryptocurrency, the most popular product built on the ledger, Decentralised Finance (DeFi), NFTs and of course, the metaverse.
The participation of women in the Nigerian tech sector is low. In a survey of 93 technology companies by ONE Campaign and the Center for Global Development, it was discovered that only six had a woman in a top management position. Worse still, more than one-third of the surveyed companies employed no women at all.
There is an even lower concentration of women in the blockchain sector. For someone who has to constantly talk about this industry as her job, how does Vivian manage to hold her end in conversations?
“Before I go into any type of meeting, I do research about everything. I might not be fully knowledgeable about a topic but I always make sure to have an idea,” she said.
Vivian is often the only woman in the room and according to her, this has its challenges.
“Being talked over is one major challenge. It’s a general problem, not just in tech. They feel you don’t have much to offer. If you do have anything to offer, you become unlikable because they feel you’re challenging them in their space. There is always doubt about your capacity in the tech industry,” she said.
Her solution to this challenge, however, is to speak up wherever and whenever she can.
“I try to show my capacity in any space. So when opportunities come or when I seek them out, I am always prepared. Women in tech should push themselves out to be heard, don’t let anything shut you down or out at any point,” Vivian said.
Female representation in tech 

The general orientation is that to be in the tech industry means to know how to code. This often discourages people from venturing into the space. But the truth is that the fast-growing tech industry is a big one that allows people to operate in different capacities. There are other roles that aren’t centered on being a software developer; these roles include project management, technical writing, and designing. 
For Vivian, the beginning of a journey in tech is to have basic computer knowledge. She took courses in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, just to have some knowledge about computing but her conclusion is that being a developer isn’t the only path to having a tech career.
“You can learn shortcuts on how to type so you don’t get scared. Go on Google, there are a lot of things. Know the basic things. We don’t have to all be developers”Vivian Agbata
An avid movie lover, Vivian recognizes the impact and influence of other women in tech. she cites Jacquelyn Madu, CEO of AzaPay, and Ruth Iselema, CEO of Bitmama as women she admires in the tech industry.
“There are a lot of women doing great, I admire their strength and hard work. Women like Jacquelyn, CEO of Azapay and Bitmama. It’s really intriguing,” she said.
As a player in the tech space, Vivian sees it as a new and exciting life, one in which she has more to offer and which could offer her more. She is passionate about introducing more women to this life. During my conversation with Vivian, it is obvious that she derives joy in enlightening her friends and anyone who cares to listen on how to utilize various opportunities within the crypto space and Blockchain.
For women in tech and those looking to start a career in tech, her advice is to be productive and make an impact.
“More women need to take up space. Make noise, be productive, make yourself known and create an impact. There’s a lot out there for women in tech, it’s not for men alone.”Vivian Agbata
Visibility for women in tech cannot be overstated as it encourages other women while highlighting the achievements of the women in the space.

Meet 13-Year-Old Iqram Lawal Who Refuses to Quit Coding Despite High Cost of Internet and Online Courses	"13-year-old Iqram Babs Lawal is proof that curiosity does not always kill the cat. Or the girl as clearly is the case here. Born with an inquisitive mind, she was intrigued by mobile and web apps and interested in finding out what makes them tick.
In primary and secondary schools in Nigeria, the concept of exposing children to tech skills is still relatively new. Coding, programming languages, web and mobile apps are catching on more due to tech initiatives like Teens Can Code and The StemBelle.


Young children being introduced to STEM by the StemBelleSource: Thestembelle.com
Google was the first friend Iqram turned to with the question, “How do I make a mobile app?” There were many options, and “It took a while before I found Appy Pie which I used to learn how to build mobile apps at first,” Iqram told this reporter in an interview sanctioned by her guardians.
Still, it did not expose Iqram to coding and the search continued until she found Khan Academy. She said, “I liked the interface so much because it was colourful. Even a 2-year-old would want to play around the site.”
Now very proficient at coding, the Junior Secondary (JSS) 3 student has selected machine learning as her preferred career of choice.
Uneasy lies the hand that wants to code
Coding is no easy-peasy endeavour and it presents a unique assortment of challenges to a schoolgirl who is serious about it. Balancing coding with the ever-present school work, getting money for data to take online courses and actually understanding the courses being taught are just some of the challenges that Iqram faces.

But she has very good support systems. Most notable of them are her parents and brother who have encouraged and supported her growth. 
“I have my priorities right,” she says. And in that hierarchy of priorities, from Mondays to Fridays are for academics while weekends are for programming. However, on weekends when there is still schoolwork to do, her coding takes the backseat. 
Iqram Lawal
Similar to what young people venturing into tech face during their pursuit, paying for resources is a challenge that Iqram constantly faces in learning tech skills. As a student, she is dependent on her parents which means that the internet and equipment needs are borne by them.
She says, “I save as much as  I can and I apply for giveaways when I can so that I can ease some of the financial burden.”
When young tech enthusiasts attend meetups, they sometimes write codes on paper because they either do not have a laptop, cannot install software on the ones they have, or do not have good internet access. People who are dogged enough find a way of running the codes on friends’ laptops at the earliest opportunity and continue their learning. 
The high cost of data adds a financial burden on young people and their guardians. Since accessing the internet is a perpetual need, it is a cost that will always crop up again and again.

Most coding tutors online do not have young people like her in mind and sometimes, it takes a lot of time to understand what the teacher is trying to pass across. When the tutor is a foreigner, accents, talking speed and the teacher’s choice of words can sometimes put the adolescent student at a disadvantage.
While these challenges reveal how far the young techies are willing to go, making resources like laptops, good internet and quality training accessible in schools will help them in their growth.
Iqram also strongly believes that adding excursions and visits to tech companies to the list of a school’s activities will expose more young people to tech earlier. “Not all of us have to code but if we go on excursions to tech companies, it will help us to see what happens in tech and how the things we see are built,” Iqram added. 
Notwithstanding the challenges, being one more girl in tech inspires Iqram and keeps her going. Her desire is that somewhere down the line, she will also be instrumental in helping young people who are interested in tech to find their footing in the space as well.

Women In Tech: Ommo Clark Shares Her 20-Year Journey Towards Making an Impact as a Software Developer	"2020 marks Oberuomo ‘Ommo’ Clark’s 20th year in the tech industry as an expert software developer. Like mos t people, she did not set out to study a tech-related course as a student in Nigeria and in the United Kingdom.
For a little background, before she left Nigeria to study in the UK, she had written the university entrance exam and filled Law as her first, second, and third course of choice. She was so sure she wanted to be a lawyer. She did not get the admission and went to study Business Administration in London instead.


Her entry into the tech sector happened in her final year as a business administration student in the London Metropolitan University when a friend suggested that she should take on an IT-related project for the final year dissertation.
“That was when I knew that building software was what I wanted to do, I did not feel I knew enough so I studied for a Masters degree in Information Systems,” she told me in an extensive virtual interview. 
This is her story as a woman in tech.
Starting a career in software development without a care about gender
When she started her first job in Brittannia Software PLC, now Real Asset Management PLC, Ommo was one of the 4 females in the software department. While she learnt a lot on the job, what struck her most was that she was able to apply everything she had learnt as a student in her job.

“I had wondered in school if all what I was learning would actually be useful for me in the workplace or if I was just learning. It was a learning experience for me to see all what I learnt in school practically come alive as I started working in my field,” she said.
While tech is often perceived as a male-dominated field, it was different for Ommo because she saw Information Technology (IT) only as a field she liked and she went for it. 
As she said, “when a software is developed, the bits of code that make it up do not know whether it is a male that wrote them or a female. They perform based on how well they are written, regardless of the gender of the developer.”
Starting IBEZ in Nigeria
While at Real Asset Management and observing the founder and management partners of the company, she felt challenged to start her own company, noting that if they could do it then she could do it as well. She left to work with other companies including as an IT personnel with the Lehman Brothers in the UK before coming back to Nigeria.
In 2013, she started iBez Nigeria as her response to the challenges she and other people encounter while living in the country. One of the challenges was getting handymen to make repairs or get things done for homes and businesses. Realizing that it was not a problem of lack, but of not being able to reach the handymen, Ommo designed handy-jacks, and built it with her team.
When she started out, one of the big challenges she had was nurturing and growing a business in Nigeria. For her, being a woman in business in Nigeria is a daily challenge and is something she keeps working at.

She told me excitedly, “I just finished a 1-month course for women in business. There were about 25 women-owned businesses represented there by the attendees and they were businesses with years of experience. Some of them turn over millions in revenue, and yet we all came to learn how to do business better and get better results.”
Ommo at a speaking engagement
“My support system is also very important to me. I am surrounded by people who are strong and who get things done, and because of that, achieving seemingly big goals has always looked like an everyday thing to me.”
Helping people find jobs during the lockdown period
As her company, iBez, keeps growing, the challenges brought by the COVID-19 has opened up new ways for the business to make more impact on other businesses. Realising that the hardest-hit businesses at this time are those with the least digital footprints and tech infusions, the company has focused more on getting businesses online.
“We’ve been able to help a significant number of businesses get online and start selling on the e-commerce websites we build for them. On the other hand, we have also helped people re-engineer their businesses and bring back the aspects that have either fizzled away or died completely due to challenges brought by the coronavirus outbreak and other factors,” she said.

A number of small and medium scale businesses have not yet caught up with digital marketing and how to use it to their advantage. This has been glaring particularly during the lockdown period. Ommo says that for these businesses, finding ways to create trainings that are most beneficial are some of the most significant things that Ibez has done since the COVID-19 broke out in the country.
‘There are opportunities that my company has not fully explored yet, and one of them is Handy-Jacks,” she says. “This is a bittersweet one for me, because we had, and still have, a golden opportunity to make more impact with the app. We should have gotten more tradespeople signed up earlier and we should have projected and pushed the product a lot more than we have done.”
Handy-Jacks can be described as Ommo’s personal project which a number of people in iBez have worked on at different times. The application connects artisans with people who need their services. Since it was launched in March 2016, some of the people who have used it have given positive reviews about the handymen who have they have hired through the site.
A group of mechanics registered on Handy-Jack
“While the lockdown was in place, we had a lot of people reach out to us that they needed handymen, we also spoke to handymen who told us ‘we no wan thief o, we just wan work’,” she said.
“For these people, handy-jack was a product that gave them job opportunities and helped them make a living. Going forward, we are putting more focus on Handy-Jacks so that we can help more artisans consistently get good jobs and get paid.” 
As the CEO of her own company, as a student both in her undergraduate and Masters days, and in all the places she has applied herself, one of what drives Ommo is this: whatever is worth doing is worth doing well.
“When I am about to get into anything, my mindset is always to do it the best way I can. I am not a competitive person, but I like to be first and it is not because I want you to be last. I just want to be the best that I can be,” she concluded.
The story of Ommo Clark can be captured in the action phrase ‘pursuit of excellence.’ And while it has seen considerable mileage, it is only just beginning.

Women in Tech: Lola Ekugo Talks About Building Industry Ties and Upskilling Outside the Workspace	"Having worked with the prominent UK and Nigerian banks, in roles that merge technology with finance before launching her own business, Lola Aworanti-Ekugo is one of the women in Nigeria’s tech space who has experienced the corporate and entrepreneurial side of endeavour.
The career path she initially wanted to follow was Medicine but was offered admission to study Cell Biology and Genetics at the University of Lagos. Her first introduction to technology came through one of the courses she took at UniLag.


“I was not very comfortable with the course I was studying and after some time my father found out about a course called Computer Science Foundation in the United Kingdom,” Lola said. This was the time when the dotnet boom was just gaining ground and taking a computer science course sounded interesting.
As she learnt more about the JAVA programming language and started to use it to develop software that solved problems, she discovered a passion for tech that has taken her through different spaces in the tech industry.
She ventured into the fintech sector in her placement year as a student in the UK. 
UK-based South African investment bank, Investec Asset Management, had an opening for a software engineer which she applied for and got.
“I had never really thought of financial services but I went for the job anyway and it was one of the best decisions I made,” she said.
Being one of the female software engineers in the office helped Lola develop a keen focus on delivering whatever the targeted result was.
“When you go into business spaces and you are one of the few females there, you just have to think about the value that you are bringing to the table. It is not about being male or female but about being there for a reason. It is about me delivering on why I am here,” she said.
Moving back to Nigeria was always the end goal for Lola and in 2018, she moved back to the country. At the time, First Bank was looking to fill the role of Head of Digital Innovation. Innovating with technology for banks and financial customers appealed to her, and she took up the role.
Lola Aworanti-Ekugo
One of the most important things to consider while innovating in the fintech space is making sure that the people actually need the product. From her experience, she has seen that “A lot of times, people imagine that this is what the market will like and then they go and develop it. When such products hit the market, people struggle to connect with it and relate it to their daily needs.”
Suggested read: Women In Tech: Ommo Clark Shares Her 20-Year Journey Towards Making an Impact as a Software Developer
Taking things very seriously, and constantly improving her skills are personal practices that Lola holds herself by. While a lot can be learnt in the workspace, not all skills can be obtained there.
Lola and the participants of the Lead Camp
“If you stay in your workspace for a year and don’t catch up on what is going on in the industry, when you eventually want to do something in the industry, you will feel years left behind,” She added.
Being part of groups where she networks and mentors others have made the fintech industry less impenetrable to Lola.
She launched her startup, Transthat, in 2017 after she took a career break from the corporate sector. “I travel a lot, and from experience, I know that a lot of people struggle with getting peer-to-peer help in moving goods from one country to another. That was what birthed the idea of Transthat.”
Transthat ties Lola’s affinity for the fintech sector, travel space, and solving problems together. It makes it easy for people to find those who are travelling and can pick up some extra luggage with them into the country for a fee.
Moving into both the corporate and entrepreneurial endeavours presented an opportunity to test her capacity, especially for making sales. “I did not know I was such a good salesperson until I started trying to make sales when I worked with my startup,” she said.
Creating a structure and ensuring discipline have helped with the stability and growth of her startup. “When you are working for yourself, there is no one chasing you to get in line and get things done. Working for other employers had helped me build discipline that transcended into how I run my own business.”
Suggested read: #WomenInTech- How Lola Salako is Helping Cancer Patients Access the Right Specialist Care Through Oncopadi
Building a business from scratch requires setting goals that are attainable and having the discipline to pursue them. As the COVID-19 has shown when it shut down international travels and slowed Transthat down, staying true to pursuing the long term goals and being able to adapt are critical, in Lola’s opinion.
To close this series, here are some personal things about Lola Aworanti-Ekugo. Her favourite colour is green and travelling is one of the things that helps her unwind and refocus.

5 Women That Defined the Nigerian Tech Space in 2019	"Whew! 2019 has seen a lot of major players shake the tech space, from ventures like Opay and Kuda to individuals like Bosun Tijani and Omowale David-Ashiru, however, the list is not complete without a look at the top 5 women who shaped the Nigerian tech space in 2019.
The women listed here created tech-inclusive opportunities for women hit milestones in their careers and businesses or made a huge impact through their leadership roles in their various tech organisations.From Oreoluwa Lesi that runs a tech initiative for females to Omowale David-Ashiru and Mohini Ufeli that have handled demanding roles and rose to the top in tech spaces. 


From Oreoluwa Lesi that runs a tech initiative for females to Omowale David-Ashiru and Mohini Ufeli that have handled demanding roles and rose to the top in tech spaces. 
The list also includes Moyinoluwa Adeyemi and Temie Giwa-Tubosun, women who have worked hard and hit milestones in their tech careers.
Let’s meet them!
Omowale David-Ashiru
Omowale has worked for more than 12 years in various tech spaces, including Accenture. She went from being an analyst to a senior management consultant and senior manager in Accenture before joining the Andela team.  Recently, she was announced as the new Country Director for Andela in Nigeria. She is the first woman to occupy that position.
Omowale David-Ashiru
Omowale, sharing her story during the TechWomenLagos organised by Techcabal, revealed the one advice she gives to women building a career in any field: belief, be bold, break ceilings.
Oreoluwa Lesi
Oreoluwa started the Women’s Technology Empowerment Center (W.TEC) to help women become entrepreneurs and professionals in the tech sector.
Since she started the organisation 11 years ago in 2008, Oreoluwa has stuck to the goal, constantly finding new ways to help women develop their skills and passion for tech.
Oreoluwa Lesi
Earlier this month, W.TEC was recognised by the Equals Global Partnership in Berlin with the Equals in Tech awards for the Skills category.
Over time, W.TEC has made a huge impact for about 10,000 females, helping them find their feet in the tech space, according to the organisation.
Moyinoluwa Adeyemi
Moyinoluwa Adeyemi is an android developer with 5 years of experience in the field. A close follow-up of Adeyemi on her social accounts reveals a woman with a passion for learning and sharing knowledge.

Recently, because of her diligence, she hit the milestone of being the first Nigerian to be certified a Google Developer Expert.
“Although a background in Computer Science is not required to become a software developer, it is always a plus. But I daresay that is not the reason I’m an Android developer now. I think the major factor that has helped me so far is that I learnt how to learn very early in my journey. I taught myself how to build Android Apps and it has been a continuous process of updating my knowledge in order to remain relevant.”Moyinoluwa Adeyemi
Mohini Ufeli
Mohini Ufeli’s story is a testament to the fact that you do not necessarily have to know how to code to be in tech. Fresh from the university with an educational background in English and Multimedia journalism, and a photography skill set, Ufeli started her first job in Nigeria as a photographer in Andela.

Ufeli’s work is an integral part of the Andela story. During her time there, she created compelling brand stories that attracted prospective staff, employees and partners alike and saw the company grow from 40 people to 500 when she left.
“There are a few factors that I believe set me apart. 1. There’s a certain mindset I cultivated as a result of coming from a US university. That’s not to say that Nigerians working at a top tech company like Andela don’t have it, but that for me the transition into that environment was easier because I had a certain attitude around timeliness, excellence, integrity, ownership. These are things that professionals older and more established are still learning.”Mohini Ufeli
3 years 9 months later, armed with the knowledge she had garnered, Ufeli left Andela to work with Paystack where she is doing the same storytelling at a different level; as a Media Manager.
Temie Giwa-Tubosun
Although Temie Giwa-Tubosun started Lifebank in 2015, she snags a spot on this list as one of the winners of the $250,000 Africa Netpreneur Award. She was also awarded the Jack Ma African Business Hero award.
Giwa-Tubosun’s passion for her work stems from her own traumatic experiences in Nigeria’s healthcare sector. Her work in Lifebank is to make essential medical products accessible in the sector by deploying artificial intelligence and smart logistics as well as mobile and web tech.

In her words, “Just do it. It is a brave new world where you can be judged based on the work you do.” 
Dazzal

‘Banks Told me I was too Young to Buy Stocks’ – Tomie Balogun on why she Ventured into Investments	"Tomie Balogun did not start out with the goal to provide highly sought-after financial insights for over 60,000 Millenials by the year 2021. But, when she realized that she had a challenge with increasing her wealth even after working a number of corporate jobs, she decided to do something about it.
Currently, her fintech startup, The Green Investment Club, is on the verge of committing a 6-figure fund in dollars into a venture capital (VC) vehicle to be invested into African startups. TGIC has invested over $14 million into small and medium businesses and created more than 2,000 jobs. Tomie is also the founder of The Vestract Company; a financial education and investment opportunity platform.


Tomie Balogun
Of course, all that money is not from one person alone. It is from hundreds of Nigerian millennials who otherwise wouldn’t be able to form part of the investment capital base for a VC.

Hardly does a week go by without news of an African startup receiving funding. However, the knowledge of how to sort through the risks associated with investing as well as the process of investing is not as commonplace in Africa as in other parts of the world.
Nigeria women make up 70% of the TGIC. This probably shows that women make up a larger percentage of the population in need of knowledge about investing, especially in African startups. It could also mean that more women are more welcoming of the company. 
“One of the major reasons why TGIC has more women than men is because I, as the founder, am a fellow woman who has found a way to solve the challenge with tech,” Tomie said.
Tomie Balogun at her book launch
Like in other tech sub-sectors, women find it easier to engage with tech products, clubs and ideas as well as develop some of their own when there are other women that are doing well in the field. 
Unless people know when a startup is raising funds, they cannot consider putting their money in it. Not having access to information is a big obstacle that prevents people from taking advantage of credible investment ventures.
When she started TGIC, she looked forward to when young people would be able to invest in VCs and opportunities that could put them on the path to financial independence. However, the extent to which people can invest is also limited to the available amount of money. To invest as a Limited Partner in most VCs, the ticket can be as high as $100,000 or more depending on the firm itself.

A way to solve this is by using the combined investment power of many people, Tomie said. By contributing $2,000 each, 20 people can form one limited partner and invest in critically-assessed startups through a VC vehicle. An increasing percentage of women are finding ways to be a part of VCs by following this route.
Too young to invest in stocks?
Until recently, it was not easy to invest in stocks, bonds and many of the other ventures available in the business space in Nigeria. Flashback to 7 years ago in 2014, Tomie said she was turned down by banks who told her that she was too young to be investing in the stock market. 
Tomie at an event
After finding ways to invest, the many processes to be completed before dividends can be received also discourage many from going this route. Instead, shady investment prospects like the recently-crashed MBAforex with lesser barriers to entry and greater returns become the choice alternatives for people. 
She read books, researched investment apps and found ways to invest money. Her blogs on the topic brought comments from people who wanted the knowledge and she built the TGIC community around that need.
Also read: ‘Limiting Mindsets Prevent Women from Making the Most of Tech Communities’ – Temilade Adelakun
Tomie’s first investment in a startup was in a business that had a model similar to Uber’s. Uber had not yet expanded into Nigeria as at then, and together with some friends, she put money into the startup. 
The way the business worked was that people who needed a ride to and from work would subscribe to the startup at a price. A designated driver will take the person to work in the morning and go back to give him a ride home.
With the investment, the startup bought more cars and business picked up but Tomie and her friends got burned. She said, “I learnt a very vital lesson back then. The integrity of the person whose business you are investing in matters a lot.”
One of the most recurrent answers that African entrepreneur give to the question, “what are your top 3 challenges in business?” is raising funds. This is even more so for women-led startups compared to their male-led counterparts so, clearly, more Africans need to believe and invest in African businesses.
However, investing in the right startup requires a depth of intelligence and a volume of money that may not be available at the start. Tomie’s journey from being broke to being able to rightly invest tells that it is possible to achieve both.

#WomenInTech- How Lola Salako is Helping Cancer Patients Access the Right Specialist Care Through Oncopadi	"After losing her sister to kidney cancer 16 years ago, Dr Lola Salako developed a passionate interest in cancer care. This led to the launching of Sebeccly Cancer Care, a platform which uses technology to amplify the existing ways cancer care was being carried out. This is her story.
‘Oncopadi’ is a coined term which means a friend of cancer patients. It is a cancer care app created by Dr Lola Salako out of a need to increase access to cancer specialist care in the country.


“There are less than 100 radiation oncologists for the 140,000 known cancer patients in the country. One way we can bridge the access gap and get more patients to see the right specialist on time is by leveraging digital health tools,” Dr Salako told me.
For her, the need for the cancer app was very evident because of the activities of Sebeccly Cancer Care, the NGO she started in memory of her sister. In 2018, Sebeccly screened 3,000 women for cancer and increased the number to 7000 in 2019. 
The goal to increase the number of screened persons yearly meant that more people would be in need of specialist care and there needed to be a way to refer patient and monitor their health.
Consultations and treatments for cancer leaves a huge dent in the pockets of people who are able to afford them. For most people, treatment is not on their radar because of low spending power. 
To take the edge off this problem, Oncopadi has the support of many radiation oncologists in Nigeria.
Besides the goodwill of Sebeccly Cancer Care that Oncopadi leverages, radiation oncologists volunteer their time to consult and give their expertise to patients. The healthtech startup is preparing for its first round of funding to help scale its operations.

The Oncopadi model
According to Lola Salako, the Oncopadi platform runs two models. While there are those who come online and volunteer, there are those who come online with their patients and use Oncopadi as an enterprise platform to render telemedicine services to them. 
Hospitals and specialists who want to use the platform to render medical services virtually can book sessions or clinic days per week ahead on the platformDr Lola Salako
A consultation on Oncopadi entails a 1-hour session with the consultant, access to an electronic medical record, a consultation summary with a clear referral line which can be a doctor’s number or name to ask for in the public hospital.
Dr Salako explained that Oncopadi is very particular about referring patients to public hospitals because the goal is to strengthen the structures that are already available, not replace them. Except a patient specifically requests for it, specialists who use the platform do not refer patients to private hospitals or those outside the country.

https://technext.ng/2020/04/23/womenintech-how-a-5000-funding-spurred-oreoluwa-lesi-to-empower-more-than-10000-girls-with-digital-skills/

Cost of care for cancer patients in the public health sector is high and limited. Still, there are partnerships and initiatives that have been put in place to make cancer care affordable for all and sundry. If these initiatives are implemented, it would help with patient care especially as most patients only need aid with part of the cost, not all.
Innovating with COVID-19
Just like everywhere else in the world, COVID-19 has disrupted a lot of the plans that Sebeccly Cancer Care had for the year. One of these plans is the goal to screen 10,000 people for cancer across primary healthcare centres in the country which has been put on hold. 
However, the pandemic just made the need for Oncopadi more pressing because cancer cells keep growing regardless of lockdowns and people need to be able to access specialists when appropriate. 
Dr Lola Salako however assured that Oncopadi is adapting to the current needs of patients. She explained that counselling sessions and survivor group sessions now happen on the Oncopadi platforms.
We optimized the platform to help people analyse their symptoms to detect risk level for the COVID-19. Those who are symptomatic are referred to the right hospitals and the hospitals themselves are alerted ahead of the patient’s visitLola Salako
All of Oncopadi’s services can be found in its web app. This includes a health shop which is run in partnership with healthcare providers to help people get tests done at discounted prices.
On the platform, anyone can ask their health-related questions and receive answers and referrals from any of the 8 specialists who volunteer on the chat. The survivor peer groups for cancer patients are closed and are only accessible to patients on the platform.
Most memorable achievements
For Salako, the achievements she considers most dear to her are Sebeccly’s attempt to create a Guinness Record and the people that go through the Cancer care program and those that make it work.

We did not create the Guinness record but we got 7,598 people to form the pink ribbon for breast cancer awareness in Nigeria. We lost the record by 600 people to another organization in the middle east but the highlight was that such a huge number of people came out to create the awareness with usLola Salako
“Another highlight is the volunteers, staff, cancer survivors who have been a part of our activities. We work in such a way that when people leave us, they leave as better versions of themselves. Many of our volunteers have gone on to pursue careers in Oncology”.
“The most rewarding thing is to see people learn from your well, and then create more wells from the community that everyone gets to draw from.”Dr Lola Salako
Going forward
One of the next targets for Dr Lola Salako is borne out of concern for the emotional well-being of oncologists in the field because oncology is a tedious field where it is easy for people to get burnt out and continuously undergo emotional distress because of the high death rate in that field. 
The target, therefore, is to create solutions or set up structures that cater to the oncologists even as they cater to patients.
“My decisions are based on why I started Sebeccly and Oncopadi in the first place. I started it to help people live healthier, happier lives,” Salako says. 
A number of people share the same passion, and currently, Dr Salako runs a program called X-Labs. Here, medical students and healthcare enthusiasts are exposed to digital health, ongoing projects and innovations in the medical field that can give them a better grasp of telemedicine.
Still at the early stages of the journey, Salako foresees that the positive consequences of Oncopadi and Sebeccly on cancer patients and healthcare in the country can only continue to increase with funding, volunteering and participation from relevant stakeholders.

Girls4Tech: How Mastercard is Addressing the Shortage of Tech Skills Among Nigerian Women	"Mastercard has launched its Girls4Tech programme in Nigeria. This programme, the first for this year, involves a total of 60 girls between the ages of nine and 12 from the Holy Child College in Lagos. The girls were tutored about the importance of science and technology and why it is imperative that they consider careers in those fields.
Girls4Tech program aims to spark STEM interest in young girls
The Mastercard Girls4Tech programme is a hands-on, inquiry-based Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programme which also incorporates Mastercard’s deep expertise in payments technology and innovation. Mastercard employees serve as mentors and role models who guide participants through the practical and fun exercises. 


Topics covered by the program includes
encryption, fraud detection, data analysis, digital convergence, cybersecurity
and AI. The program also emphasizes important skills such as collaboration,
creativity and communication to enable young girls apply their technical
knowledge to solve real-world challenges.
Through our Girls4Tech programme, we’re extending our commitment to Nigeria’s next generation of women leaders. We are developing a talented pipeline of STEM professionals to support the country’s future economy, by encouraging girls to embrace the subjects that will prepare them for the workforce of tomorrow. Ifeoma Dozie, Director, Marketing and Communications, Sub-Saharan Africa at Mastercard 
Inspiring young girls to build the skills
they need in STEM is important, as it ensures that more women have a voice in
the development of the products and services of the future. According to an
IPSOS survey, 89% of African women are the decision-makers or
co-decision-makers for household purchases, yet UNESCO says the share of women
working in research and development (R&D) is just 32% in Sub-Saharan
Africa.
To this end, Ifeoma Dozie says the Girls4Tech programme is helping to prepare young women for careers in STEm with the aim of ultimately improving their employability and increasing their opportunities for prosperity and success. 

And because it is critical to have women
represented in the decision-making, engineering and innovation processes, these
young women would become a strong voice in the conversations that are driving
the digital economy. 
“Connecting people to possibilities is
fundamental to what we do at Mastercard. It’s what Priceless is all about
–unlocking the potential in every person across all parts of their lives. By
creating a world with women in mind, and women involved, we can unlock
limitless possibilities for us all,” Ifeoma said. 
Ranked 128th out of 153 countries in the
2020 Global Gender Gap Report, women currently make up only 22% of Nigeria’s total
number of engineering and technology university graduates. The growing demand
for STEM graduates in Nigeria’s workforce means increased opportunities for
women in future.
Since its launch in April 2014 in the
United States, Girls4Tech has reached more than 500,000 girls in 28 countries,
including over 100 girls in Nigeria. Mastercard has further committed to reach
1 million girls globally by 2025. Additional programmes will be rolled out to
schools in Lagos later this year.

Odunayo Eweniyi Talks About Digital Identity and How Women Can Gain More Visibility in the Tech Space	"In a podcast by Seamfix titled Identity and Tech Talk, Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of Piggyvest, Odunayo Eweniyi, discussed digital identity, financial inclusion, and how women can get more visibility in the tech space. Here are the major takeaways.
Digital identity accelerates business processes and growth
Digital identity refers to a set of attributes that are conected to only one person or organisation on a digital channel. The major contribution of digital identity to businesses is access.


Eweniyi explained that for businesses, having access to comprehensive details of current or prospective customers is a way to grow. It helps them improve targeting for services, and have holistic views of the customers they are trying to serve.

She explained that for most fintech, the goal is to onboard people who already have an accepted form of digital identity which is the Bank Verification Number (BVN). 
In this regard, digital identity promotes financial inclusion because fintechs are looking to onboard customers who can be traced and whose activities they have reasonable control over. This is especially crucial because of the risk of fraudulent activities associated with financial transactions.
Focusing on the lockdown period, digital identity has not been particularly helpful to promote financial inclusion. This is because only people with existing digital identity can access financial services attached to it. People that did not previously have it cannot obtain it while the lockdown is still on.
What makes up a good digital identity?
Using America’s Social Security Number, Eweniyi was of the opinion that a good digital identity should capture information such as birth certificate, driver’s license, bank account details, address and such. It should make everything interconnected and trackable.
From where Nigeria is currently, collaboration between the Government and the private sector would be a good way to start to create a comprehensive digital identity system that provides a one-stop identity module or channel. 

We are having such an incredible time connecting with our #IDTGang Listen to @OdunEweniyi share some tips & tricks. https://t.co/lAcTJCV3mnAvailable now: Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Tune in.#seamfix #ownyourstory #womenintech pic.twitter.com/0pjKVkF515— SEAMFIX (@seamfixltd) April 28, 2020

As the conversation rolled on, the focus shifted to the gender bias that women encounter in the workplace and in hiring situations.
How Odunayo Eweniyi has thrived despite prevalent gender imbalance
Speaking from her own background, Eweniyi mentioned how her parents raised her to be a fighter and to not take ‘no’ for an answer. 
For every single piece of progress I have made, I fought for it, but the flip side to that is that I had incredible men in my life who are also fighting along with meOdunayo Eweniyi
In her opinion, visibility is a combination of the men understanding that they need to make space for the women, and the women also fighting for what they want.
It is also important for women to surround themselves with the community that does what they are interested in doing, whether they are male or female.

https://technext.ng/2020/04/23/womenintech-how-a-5000-funding-spurred-oreoluwa-lesi-to-empower-more-than-10000-girls-with-digital-skills/

According to Eweniyi, being in male-dominated spaces had been the norm for her as she grew up, and she embraced the fact that no one is better because of their biological makeup. This remained the norm as she progressed to Covenant University to study Computer Engineering, and emerged top of her class.
As the focus shifted a bit to work ethics, Eweniyi mentioned the need for people to also define what they can and cannot do. “People need to be comfortable with saying I don’t know when they don’t know,” she said.
What can women do to improve technical and leadership skills in the workspace?
Speaking generally, because improving skills is something that both men and women need to do, her first nugget was to learn and upskill constantly. She emphasized that there are materials and resources on the internet that have a lot to offer in improving skills. 
In addition to learning, there is a huge need for grit and determination. 
As the chat moved to an end, she shared how Piggyvest was working on bridging the gender gap and getting more people to take up leadership roles in the organization. 

https://technext.ng/2020/03/11/54gene-piggyvest-and-8-other-african-startups-make-fast-companys-list-of-most-innovative-companies/

According to her, appreciating people for their skills when they do well is a good way of bolstering confidence and helping them see their importance in the grand scheme of things.
Another thing she shared from Piggyvest’s culture is the approach to handling mistakes. According to her, sometimes when mistakes are made, it is not enough to correct the mistakes. One has to dig deep and find out what was responsible for the mistake.
Sharing the three values that are non-negotiable for her, Odunayo Eweniyi mentioned that the first is honesty. The second value is that any activity she engages in has to make an impact. And the third is that she gives 110% to whatever she does.
As each one strives to do their part and do it well, visibility is something that can be achieved for all in the tech space.

Julie Ako speaks on building Albantsho to connect screenwriters and producers in Africa	"About a year ago, Julie Ako, now co-founder and CEO of Albantsho graduated from the Multichoice Talent Factory, emerging as the winner of the Nihilent award. she has also won the Afriff award for the short film she wrote as, the best student, Bride Untangled.
But her journey to the upper echelons of the Nigerian Nollywood film didn’t start from there. she had spent the past two years building Albantsho a marketplace of some sort for Nollywood creatives.


“Although I studied computer science at the University of Benin,” she said in a new interview with tech next. “When I left school I decided I wanted to go into screenwriting and filmmaking fully because it’s something I passionately had a flair for and I had always written screenplays even while I was an undergraduate, which made it easy for me to transition into film making”– Julie Ako
On this week’s women in tech, Julie speaks to us about her journey to building a media-tech startup, that provides solutions for both screenwriters and producers in the filmmaking industry. 

Temiloluwa Oyetayo: ‘Women in tech overcompensate and it can be a burden’

Ako, who is also a screenwriter herself never imagined she would ever go into “tech” but spotting a need in the film industry spurred her to come up with a solution that would make the film making the process more seamless for all players involved from screenwriter to producer, from sourcing a script to final production.
The solution is Albantsho. 
The journey to Albantsho
An opportunity to be a part of the multichoice talent factory helped her gain more exposure and with it came the realization of how much collaboration was needed to complete a project in the film industry. 

“ I applied for the multi-choice talent factory and got in on a year-long residency. During that time, I was exposed to all aspects of filmmaking beyond what I knew and realized that the film industry is such a collaborative industry and needs a lot of competent hands to make a single project successful. I realized if one aspect is not working right, it affects the outcome of the whole project.”
Armed with a new level of exposure to the film world, which also brought a deeper understanding of the myriad of challenges impeding the telling of stories as they would like to be told in the industry, Ako sought to come up with a solution that would tackle some of these problems.
The Birth of Albantsho
After her stint at the Multichoice Talent Factory, she wasn’t still ready to take on the challenge of producing movies:  “ I wasn’t in a position to make films as an art as I wanted to, especially since to do that, you need to have your own resources and to create a commercial entity, there is a lot to consider.” She said.
Yet, she decided to create something that could be of equal value. And, the question is what?
“So rather than just sit idle and complain the industry is not how it’s supposed to be, I thought to myself what are the challenges facing the industry? what can I do about them with my background in computer science and love for film? And create this convergence where solutions can be created.” 
Ako says this was how the idea of Albantsho came about, a fusion of two words, Albasa which is Hausa for Onion and Ntsho the Setswana word for black, making Albantsho – meaning Black onion.
Shedding more light on her reason for choosing the name, Julie says:
“ I wanted to make it very African centric which is where the name came from because we want African writers to feel connected to their African roots and have access to data that improve their story, and then producers can have this platform where they are assured of quality stories. It is a multi-layered solution, just like African stories can be which is how the idea to use an onion which is also multilayered came about”. 
Fully aware of the many challenges from funding, distribution, scripting, structure etc…facing the film industry, Ako decided to start with screenwriting not only because she is a screenwriter herself, but because she believes “ screenwriting is the foundation of filmmaking in the first place. So I started thinking and making research towards what we can build to move our industry further”. 
That signalled the start of Albantsho in 2020. Julie and her team are looking at launching fully in Q2 of 2022.
“The solution we seek to provide is to create a platform that would be a bridge between writers and producers,”
Albantsho: a platform from a community
Albantsho started first as a community that grew into a solution, Julie said.
“Every time we meet writers a common theme is always we don’t know what to do with our script, especially for those who didn’t know anyone in the industry. The solution we seek to provide is to create a platform that would be a bridge between writers and producers, which is what we realized was the missing link. I realized that even in Hollywood, there are purely tech driven agencies and communities that help writers access resources and get their work seen”. 
Julie started working with fellow multi-choice talent factory alumni, Nikita Mogware to create this platform. While Nikita is focused on the education part of the solution, Julie was focused on the technology and backend workings.
From the onset, they sought to create a hub where young African screenwriters can get involved in each other’s work and bring a sense of authenticity to the work and give genuine feedback that screenwriters may not get anywhere else. 
Julie believes that
“ for African filmmakers to be an industry to be taken seriously as they ought to be, I believe that having solutions in the industry important, one of the ways is to create access to data and also help writers to feel like there is a direction for their work”. 
Simply put, Albantsho seeks to create an easy and efficient way for writers and producers to transact on their story acquisition.  The vision is to leverage technology to unfold the many layers of African stories left untapped. 
Film making X tech, how acceptable? 
Speaking on acceptability from screenwriters and other industry players, Julie reveals that the level of acceptability has been really good:
“ What we are doing is to take what we believe is workable and create a market there to encourage growth and a better structure for the industry. That is why getting others interested has been relatively easy, we have the screenwriters guild interested in what we are building because they see how what we are doing will help solve problems for writers. in areas like where the portfolios of writers can be found, what is their rate, how many awards they have won and other necessary information.”
She also spoke on how producers have also interest because they see the need. 
“ Producers are seeing the need and are hoping it delivers on its promises and they have shown interest. We have a workshop coming up in which a lot of them are involved. This shows us there is a market for what we are building. In fact, we have production studios that have bided for scripts even before the official product launch” 
The business model
At the core of their business model, Julie explains, is that Albantsho is an aggregator for creators, buyers and sellers. Here they have access to tools and to each other to transact.
In turn, writers pay the platform a commission fee when they sell their scripts, while the producers are allowed access based on a subscription plan.
“I have always believed that you can go as far as possible if you want to be in a space”.
“ We want a seamless entrance for the writers so they do to have to pay anything until they sell a script. Our business model is commission-based and subscription for premium producers who want certain access or create certain projects”, she explained.
Speaking on how the writers play for the services that will be offered on the platform, Ako reveals what the concerns are:
“ Writers have always been dealt the shorter end of deals in the industry. So, it’s important to us that they feel this is different and prioritise the writers. Also to ensure that the producers get value for their money, the quality of the script has to be a top-notch quality that producers are happy to pay for. So the writers are paying in time and resources except they want to get their work professionally revised that they would pay for.”
Challenges as a woman in tech
As much as there are numerous challenges facing women in tech, Julie says she is barely aware she is a woman in tech as she’s used to existing in male-dominated spaces.
“ I recognise that it is quite harder for women to access resources or knowledge in certain areas. I also believe that a lot has improved. I am barely aware that I am a woman in tech, I work easily in a male-dominated environment. This is evident in my background in computer science and the filmmaking industry. I have never seen it as a hindrance because I have always believed that you can go as far as possible if you want to be in space”.
Advice to women in tech
Julie has a piece of very simple advice for women looking to come into tech, filmmaking, engineering or any other sector for that matter: build capacity!
“ My advice to women regardless of the sector is that so long as that desire is in you to go into a certain field then focus on building capacity. This is because if you build capacity it will be impossible for anyone to ignore you as a woman. When you chase capacity, you break down the walls that are hindering your entrance into any specific role or any goal. So just focus on building capacity and learning as much as you can. If there are problems affecting your learning, don’t be quiet, be very vocal about it and ask questions”. 
While Julie has plans for organising a screenwriter’s workshop and launching Albantsho in the nearest future, she still has other plans for the future.
Speaking about where she sees herself in the future, she said that she is excited about what the future will look like in the next five years.
“ I see a lot of growth for writers, a better structure in the filmmaking industry in Nigeria. There are a lot of positive investments into the creative economy from companies like Netflix and we are still a growing market so in the next five years. I am looking at more tech products being created within the film industry. I am looking at better stories being told, internationally and critically acclaimed stories told by us and not just being a small part of the story”.

Women in Tech: How Teni Stuffman Developed Vas2Nets Through Her Passion for Tech	"2006. The final year students from the Federal University of Technology, Akure, had just graduated. Most graduands from the department of Applied Geology were contemplating the next move that would get them into the Oil and Gas sector.
One of them was contemplating how she could join Channels TV station because she was sure she wanted to become a broadcaster. That was how Teni Stuffman began a journey that started from broadcasting and led to tech.


Teni began at Eko FM where she volunteered to work for free. From there, she volunteered at TVC at its inception and was employed as a part-time staff. On she went to Super Screen as a newscaster and reporter before she moved on to AIT and joined the morning show. 
While she was with AIT,  Teni covered the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Eventually, she was able to get into Channels and was a part of the Business Morning show.
While at TVC, she had come into contact with someone who was to deploy a mobile solution for the station. According to her, “I was really engrossed with the fact that your phone can communicate with the TV, that was a killer for me. I wanted to know how it worked and if it could be employed in other sectors such as Agriculture, medicine.”
Teniola Stuffman
By the time Teni Stuffman was ready to leave Channels, she was sure the next thing she wanted to do was in the healthTech sector. This was why she joined Vas2nets technologies.
The foray into mobile tech
Since 2009 when she joined Vas2Nets, Teni Stuffman has been a part of key mobile health products which include Dial A Doctor, Mobile Midwives, and Health360. All these products were health-inclined and reflect the passion she felt for maternal and child healthcare.
“I was so passionate about maternal and child healthcare because of my personal experience and what I had heard people go through. So, that drove my involvement in healthtech.”Teni Stuffman, Business Development Director of Vas2Nets Technologies
The results of her work brought on partnerships with GSMA, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Clinton and Hillary Foundation, Hello Mama and others. 
But Teni says that perhaps one of the most important highlights of her work in healthtech was when a lady called through Dial A Doctor, very scared and bleeding. The doctor was able to calm her down and walk her through the right procedures to recovery, all from the mobile health solution the team had deployed.

Besides the mobile health sector, agriculture was another field where Teni wanted to create solutions to several problems. She travelled to states in the North and West to have a closer interaction with the farmers and determine their real challenges. 
A major challenge was financial inclusion. So the Vas2Nets team started looking at mobile solutions that could be developed to equip more farmers with financial services. 
Teni Stuffman is not a programmer, and her work in tech has bordered a lot on business development. 
“There is a lot of space to play in when it comes to technology and business model. While people often see the coding and analytical part of technology, there is also the business side of it,” she said.

https://technext.ng/2020/04/23/womenintech-how-a-5000-funding-spurred-oreoluwa-lesi-to-empower-more-than-10000-girls-with-digital-skills/

While she is not into data science herself, she believes that data science and analytical fields are areas that can do with more women. 
“There are still many challenges around, and it is a need-based thing. The need does not segregate gender and anyone that can meet the need can do that regardless of gender and continuous learning along the way is very important,” Teni tells me.



What drives Teni daily as an Executive Director of Vas2Nets? People. Seeing people break limits with the functionalities and services that a tech product puts at their fingertips. The drive to help people become better is the reason she volunteers with the Technical Community at Institute of Directors, and as an Associate at WIMBIZ.
What does a regular day look like for Teni Stuffman? She “prays, readies the children for school and gets into work. I work round the clock and attend to clients when needed at all hours of the day. I give myself a treat when I have worked especially hard and I just relax.” 
Rest is sweet after working hard.

From Environment to tech: Clara Odero talks about working at 2 unicorns, 1 decacorn and running a startup	"As much as we say women are underrepresented in tech, there are still incredible women who are launching and building successful, innovative tech companies that are upending industries, setting new standards and earning their place in the tech industry. These women create and innovate, exploiting ideas, products and services to produce dynamic businesses.
As with most people who transition into tech, Clara Wanjiku Odero started from a different field entirely. She began her career as an environmental scientist.  This choice of career was inspired by Wangari Maathai, a Kenyan environmental activist who was awarded the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize, becoming the first Black African woman to win a Nobel Prize.


Originally, Clara wanted to study law but changed her mind after listening to Wangari Maathai, thanks to a PeaceJam fellowship. PeaceJam is an international education program built around Nobel Peace Prize Laureates who work personally with youths to pass on the spirit, skills, and wisdom they embody.
Armed with a degree in environmental science, she went into International Development- carbon monitoring. However, she discovered that the field was different from what she expected. Clara has a strong sense of justice and she often talks about making a difference. Her work, which was a well-paid job, entailed going to poor communities and seeing how to help but she was dissatisfied as she felt she wasn’t actually making a difference.
 It just wasn’t congruent to the things I wanted to do in life and I didn’t think we were actually making a change.Clara Odero on international development
This is not the only reason why she left though. She mentions a glass ceiling for women, especially black women in international development. Upper management was for white people and this realization led her to the next phase of her career, tech.
1 decacorn, 2 unicorns, a startup 
Clara represented Kenyatta University, Kenya in the 2008 Zain Africa Challenge, a televised academic competition for students of African universities. Her university lost out at the semi-finals stage because she listened to outside opinion instead of her intuition. And this was a big learning point for her.
We lost because I let people tell me who to place as captain of the team, someone who had never played. Now, I am a big believer in following my intuition.
Listening to her intuition led her to abandon her pursuit of a business degree to move to Nigeria and to work at Flutterwave. After leaving International Development, she reached out to her friend, Iyin Aboyeji, co-founder of Flutterwave and thus began her career in tech. 
Clara Wanjiku Odero
Not many women can boast of working top positions at two fintech unicorns but Clara Wanjiku Odero is one of those women. She worked at Flutterwave, as the Head of Implementation. Afterwards, she acted as Director of Network Operations, Africa at Rapyd, an Israeli unicorn. Her last position before setting out on her own endeavour was as VP Growth and Partnerships at Nium.
One would think working at these impressive places is enough but it turned out to be quite the opposite for Clara.  
“There was nothing left. It was time for a bigger challenge, for me to grow, I am a big believer in pushing myself to limits.”
Her experiences in those impressive places exposed Clara to how Africa was considered in the tech space and also the need to fill a vacuum in the African tech space.
“We were the last ones that people wanted to integrate with. It was so difficult to see us as a place to do business,” she said.
This vacuum is the need to connect all of Africa in order to sell the African opportunity. 
I’m a big believer in this continent. I thought about why is it so difficult for Africa to be taken seriously. It’s because it is 50 plus countries that are broken up basically, so you have to go to each country to file in. But if you are to connect these (country), what’s the opportunity?Clara
To solve some of these problems, she set up Credrails with Teresia Kairu, a former colleague during her time in International Development and who had also gone on to be Head of Finance at BitPesa and COO of AZAFinance.
L-R: Clara Wanjiku Odero, CEO and Teresia Kairu, COO, Credrails
Countries in Africa have differing financial and monetary systems and this impacts building fintech for the continent- builders targeting Africa’s 1.3 billion people have to struggle with the many systems. Credrails’ single API connects all 55 countries, allowing developers to build for Africa with ease and quickly. 
There is such potential. We are building a business that is going to make it possible for you to reach all 50 plus countries so that involves a little bit of work. 
Within less than a year since its launch, Credrails now has access to 250 million accounts in 33 countries and is working towards connecting all of Africa, empowering fintech developers with incredible capabilities through a single API. Credrails solutions also promote interoperability across services, leading to faster and more affordable movement of money around Africa and beyond.
Life as an African female CEO
The best part of being the CEO of a tech startup, one she describes as a love letter to Africa, is her team. A humbling experience in this role is when experienced people show up wanting to work for the startup. 
We have Monday morning meetings and I keep quiet most of the meeting because people know what they are doing. You’re just watching your dream, your little idea blossoming in the hands of people who are so experienced. It has been amazing.
Clara’s passion for her business shines through as she talks about appropriately rewarding her team through a generous employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) and also making plans for the next generation of startups through Credrails.
https://www.credrails.com/
Only 2% of all funding goes to women globally. To put it into perspective, only three per cent of African tech startup funding since 2013 has gone to companies with all-female founding startups while 76% went to all-male founding startups, according to a Briter Bridges report. 
After bootstrapping the initial process, Credrails has raised $2.5m in the seed round. Although it has been somewhat difficult to raise funding, it has not proven impossible due to Clara’s experience and track record in the space.
“It hasn’t been as difficult for me but I understand that it can be difficult for a lot of people because it is about network, communication and being able to sell your idea in a way other people will get it. With investors, people trust people who sound like them. Hopefully, as we build up communities, we can change those statistics a bit,” she said.
Advocacy for women
Clara’s love for wicked people stepmothers ends in the old Nollywood movies she enjoys watching as she can be described as an advocate for women.
“We make a conscious when it comes to hiring and who our vendors are, in every single way. I can’t say that I want to be a woman in business and not support other women.”
She also believes in having advocates in business.
I think people should learn how to have an advocate at work. Someone who is going to put your work forward and speak about how your work has been good and put you up for opportunities.
This advocacy for women is also evident outside of business. Clara was a loud voice condemning the sexual harassment acts labelled against Daudi Were, executive director of Ushahidi, a Kenyan crowdsourcing platform by a former employee. 
I didn’t know this girl but the way they were treating her was so wrong. For me, right is right and wrong is wrong so I was speaking up and speaking up really loudly.
On opening up the space for other ladies to join in, Clara believes women should acquire the necessary skills and then go after what they desire.
Clara Wanjiku Odero at Vodacom’s Mobile Money Policy series in Tanzania
“In this life, you have to believe there’s nothing too good for you and there’s no room you don’t deserve to be in. Believe you deserve to be in those rooms and go after it. It is really hard for people to say no to you when you are the best and so I’ll tell anyone who wants to go into tech. work on your skillset. Become so good they can’t say no,” she said.
Clara looks up to women who break glass ceilings and names her mum and sister as women she looks up to. She also names Odunayo Eweniyi of Piggyvest, Seun Runsewe Senior Product Manager at Chipper Cash, and Barbara Iyayi, Managing Director of Unicorn Africa Investments as people who open doors in tech. This is also the goal for her, to open doors for others.
I never want to be the only African woman in the room, there is absolutely no pride in that. I want to open the door so there’s lots of us. The goal is that a lot more of us are in these rooms and these positions.

Kemisola Bolarinwa, inventor of cancer-detecting bra speaks on wearable technology	"As a young girl, Kemisola Bolarinwa already had dreams of becoming an innovator. Her favourite subjects in secondary school were Maths, Physics and Chemistry. Her interests in STEM spurred her to join the Junior Engineers, Technicians and Scientists (JETS) club in her school, St. Helen’s Unity Secondary School, Ondo. 
JETS club was created to introduce students to the STEM field and help them get practical experience. As a club member, she represented her school in different competitions, one of which she remembers with pride. In 2006, Kemisola, alongside another student representing their school, built a radio transmitter and receiver, which won 3rd place at a national JETS club competition in Jos, Nigeria. 


“The club deepened my interest in stem because I was able to get hands-on experience from what we were taught in school. Going out as a young girl and meeting my counterparts to test my knowledge deepened my interest in STEM.” 
In pursuit of her dreams, she studied Electrical and Electronics Engineering at the University of Ado-Ekiti. This course of study can be described as the launchpad for all her dreams that are now set to come through.
Kemsiola is now the CEO of Nextwear Technology, Nigeria’s first wearable tech startup.
Nextwear Tech designs and develops technology worn close to the body by embedding programmable electronics and sensors on clothing to solve societal issues such as health and communications.
STEM Gender Gap
In an exclusive interview with Technext, Kemsiola reveals a pattern she observed. For most women, it is all too well known and that is the gender gap. The CEO’s department in the engineering faculty, electrical and electronics engineering had only 11 girls as freshers. By the third year, some left to other departments and only 7 graduated.
Kemisola is an advocate for girls, as she is trying to bridge the gender gap and encouraging girls and women to seek careers in STEM. 
It is a global challenge especially when it comes to engineering. That’s why I came up with the Stem Gender Gap where I advocate for this issue. Kemisola.Bolarinwa, CEO Nextwear Technology
On education, she mentioned that the current educational system was not supportive of the practical system of learning. She attributed this to overpopulated schools with limited or archaic resources.
“It is impossible to forget hands-on learning. Hopefully, the government will review the curriculum to encourage more hands-on learning. I believe that seeing real-life applications catches your interest more than paperwork, like what happened to me. I use myself as a model because hands-on opened my mind and interest to tech.”
Speaking of education, Kemisola is a self-taught robotics engineer. After graduating as an Electrical & Electronics engineer, she discovered that her career choices were limited by the environment she found herself. Another discovery she made was that she was not equipped with the skills necessary for the new wave of technology. 
I graduated in 2010 and the new age skills essential for this 4th industrial revolution like Robotics and IoT wasn’t taught then. The university gave me fundamental knowledge but not what I actually needed.
Kemisola describes the next step in her journey as a life-changing one and the bedrock of her career. This next step was joining Baun Robotics where she started her journey into the world of computing language and programming, all thanks to the support of her incredible boss.
‘My boss gave all of us the room to use his resources, money and internet to learn as this form of education was not readily available in the country. He was really supportive. I was able to learn the programming language C++ used in robotics which I had no idea of before. I was able to learn at my own pace using videos and texts’, she says. 
She has further gone ahead to get certificates in order to validate the knowledge she learned.
Nextwear Technology innovations 
SmartBra prototype
Interestingly, Kemisola’s boss did not just give her the room to grow, he also exposed her to different areas of emerging technologies like wearable technology which she now operates in.
Researching is Kemisola’s hobby, so, when she knew about wearable technology, she deep-dived into it. Tragically, she lost her aunt to breast cancer and the idea of finding a solution took root in her mind.
In 2020, there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 685 000 deaths globally. As of the end of 2020, there were 7.8 million women alive who were diagnosed with breast cancer in the past 5 years, making it the world’s most prevalent cancer. 
Breast cancer is a threat to women globally regardless of status. I took it as a challenge. When I gained knowledge in wearable technology, I worked on it.
The best way to beat cancer is through early detection. So, Kemisola, alongside her team of five worked on a product that could detect cancer in the breasts simply by wearing it on the body for about five minutes. This product was named Smart Bra. An oncologist and a cancer researcher are on the team as they help to give insight on the medical aspect of ensuring product efficiency.
 The team in 2021 came up with a working prototype and have conducted a local trial or “troubleshooting”, as Kemisola refers to it. They recorded 87% accuracy and are now working on getting it to to the Minimum Viable Product stage (MVP) so they can do a clinical trial.
Nextwear Technology has an existing product in the market; a necklace that doubles as a tracking device. With the mobile app, a guardian can follow the journey of the wearer of the necklace. This product was created in response to the state of insecurity in the nation. Since launching it last year, Nextwear Tech, has sold over 300 units. The mother of one says this is due to the fact that the startup has not done much marketing but that is about to change.
This change is due to the fact that the SmartBra innovation has brought them some publicity, so, people’s doubts about Nigerian made products are allayed.
‘The publicity from the smart bra has helped as now they don’t have the usual doubt of “Naija made ” products. The smart bra has shown that we are capable of making excellent products.’
All these brilliant innovations have come at a cost. When asked about the funding process, Kemisola says “I can tell you that I am exhausted”. The self-funded startup has spent about ₦4 million on SmartBra alone, a cost that arises from purchasing the hardware needed and visiting different teaching hospitals to meet with oncologists.
Hardware development is capital intensive and requires a lot of time. It takes time to get it right. Funding has to be there because you have to come up with prototypes as you can’t get it on the first try.
Nextwear Technology is looking to raise some funds in a pre-seed round but is holding on until it has come up with a product that is ready for mass production. Kemisola was a recipient of a $10,000 grant in the Standard Chartered Women in Technology Incubator Programme (SC-WITI) in Nigeria.

Kemisola is looking to get more grants and angel investors to support the work as it hopes to have an international clinical trial and a mobile app for wearers of the bra to see their results. 
Kemisola has gained recognition for her work from the Federal Government of Nigeria, after meeting with the Minister of Science and Technology for State, Abdullahi Mohammed. 
She also mentions global recognition as people from all over the world express their interest in the work.
“We’ve been getting responses from all over the world as people are interested. The market is there, people are waiting for us and we cannot disappoint them. We are working on accuracy.” 

The process of building the product has been slow as the parts needed are not available in Nigeria. Orders have to be made and then the delivery takes weeks or sometimes months to get to them which is a challenge for the team.
It is evident while talking to Kemisola that she is confident in her abilities. When asked about other challenges she faces, she says gender stereotyping used to be one of it but that she has conquered it by speaking up and believing in herself.
I don’t take gender stereotyping as a challenge anymore but it was there in the beginning. I was able to beat down that challenge because I speak. You can’t look down on me or lessen my potential. 
This is also her advice to young ladies.
“The first thing is to believe in yourself, ability and potential. Without that, you might get discouraged. “
She encourages other women to get into the tech space, regardless of age or educational qualifications.
It is not too late to venture into tech. No matter your background or discipline, I would advise you to have basic knowledge in tech so you don’t get lost.
The innovator is excited about the future. Kemisola mentions that Nextwear Technology is set to launch more wearable technology products in communication and fashion. 
“We also have products coming in communication and fashion. We want to come up with a runway show at GT Fashion week with our tech meets fashion wears. People should look out for us.”

Breaking: Nigeria Records 21% Reduction in Daily Coronavirus Cases as Buhari Unveils Plan to Relax Lockdown	"Nigeria’s daily tally of Covid-19 cases fell even further as the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced 64 new cases in the country for April 27, 2020. With 91 cases the day before, this represents a 21% day on day reduction and brings the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 1,337.
The latest update comes as President Muhammadu Buhari revealed plans to relax lockdown in Lagos, Ogun and the FCT in a week’s time.


Lagos continued to record the most daily cases with 34 new cases, representing 53% of the total national daily tally. This gives Lagos total confirmed cases of 754, representing 56.3% of the total national confirmed cases. 
After enjoying two days without a single case, the FCT, Abuja returned to the log with 15 new cases to bring its total number of cases to 157, up from 142. This means Abuja has 11.7% of the total national confined cases.

Kano witnessed its second day in a row without a new case, which makes it three in the last four days without a new case. This is, however, attributable to the closure of the testing facility in Kano. A staff of the testing centre told Premium Times that the closure was due to shortage of testing kits. 
The minister for health, Osagie Ehanire, however, claimed it was because various members of staff were infected with Covid-19 and new staff had to be sent there. Whatever the case, the centre was reopened on Monday and we expect to see the real situation of things in Kano in the coming days.
Debutants
No new state appeared on the Covid-19 update within the last 24 hours. This makes it the first time in 6 days that a new state didn’t join the fray. The day before witnessed the entrance of four new states; Taraba,  Kebbi, Bayelsa and Ebonyi, the largest daily tally for new entrants yet.
Thus, 32 states plus the FCT have recorded cases of Covid-19. Only 4 states in Nigeria are still coronavirus-free and they include Cross River, Kogi, Nassarawa, and Yobe. 
The northeast situation
Recent figures show a worrying trend emerging from the northeast. From having some of the highest daily increase rates (Gombe with 233% and Borno with 150% both within the last 5 days) to having the highest first-time tally (Taraba debuted with 6 cases, the highest for a debutant), the region appears to have some of the more intriguing figures. 
In the recent update, Borno recorded 11 new cases to bring its total tally to 41 cases, up from 30. This represents a 36.6% increase. While it doesn’t come anywhere near its largest day on day increase rate, it is, however, still troubling.
Even more troubling is the fact that 3 of the 5 states recorded in the latest update are northeastern states. Mere coincidence? Maybe. But it might be telling the story of a slow albeit very steady rise.
Recoveries, deaths and active cases
16 new recoveries were recorded within the last 24 hours. While this is a very slight reduction from the 17 recorded a day before, it is still significant considering the falling number of cases. Total number of discharged Covid-19 cases now stands at 255. This represents a 19% recovery rate, up from 18.7% recorded the day before.

With zero deaths recorded in the last 24 hours, total number of deaths remains stagnant two days in a row (40) for the first time since April 12 and 13, 2020 (10). This is quite impressive considering there were 5 Covid-19 deaths the day before, one of the highest daily amounts of death. This sends Nigeria’s death rate crashing back to 2.9%, an improvement from 3.1% the day before.
Global death rate is currently 6.9% while global recovery rate is 30%
Number of active cases in Nigeria is 1,042, up from 994 the day before. This means active cases make up 77.9% of the total number of confirmed cases in Nigeria, very slightly lower than 78% recorded the day before.
President Buhari to relax lockdown
President Muhammadu Buhari, in an address to Nigerians, announced the federal government’s plan to relax lockdown in Lagos, Ogun and the FCT. This will include measures like allowing certain essential business to operate, ban on inter-state travel, compulsory use of a face mask as well as the imposition of night curfews.
President Buhari addresses the nation
While this may come as reprieve for many Nigerians, the measures won’t kick in until May 4th. This essentially means the lockdown remains in effect for another one week. The president however, imposed an immediate lockdown on Kano state for the next two weeks.
The lockdown on Kano was expected and in order following the rising number of mysterious deaths and the matter of the closure of testing centre in the state. The FG, however, needs to pay a little more attention to the northeastern states of Borno, Gombe, Taraba and Bauchi.

#WomenInTech – How a $5,000 Funding Spurred Oreoluwa Lesi to Empower More Than 10,000 Girls with Digital Skills	"For most women actively working in the tech sector in Nigeria, one of the major targets is to bring in other women into the tech space. This has seen the launch of many non-governmental organizations focusing on women and tech.
One of the more visible organizations is Oreoluwa Lesi’s Women Technology Empowerment Center (W.Tec). In a comprehensive chat with TechNext, Ore shared her journey towards launching an organization for women that has gone on to impact lives in their thousands and attract international recognition for its efforts.


Tell us about you
I am the eldest of three children, and though born and bred in Lagos, I am from Ogun state. I have a degree in Economics from Essex University. My background in tech was largely influenced by my parents who loved engineering. I remember the first time I came in contact with a computer was when my father bought a computer home. It did not look like what computers look like nowadays, though, but it sparked my interest.
Oreoluwa Lesi and the CEO of Technext, Mr David Afolayan
I thought computers were majorly for playing games until I went to a computer school while I was waiting for my JAMB results. I took the longest course that they had to offer because I wanted to kill the time and was tired of staying at home. The course was computer programming and taught me to write programs in COBOL and Q Basic. I learnt about the parts of the computer and really took to writing programs from there on.
I was very interested in programming, and I started asking people if I could write programs for them. I enjoy the process of writing programs, particularly the analytical aspect.
What was your first major program about?
It was an application for my parents’ bookstore. Back then, every record was kept in a notebook. It was not very effective and things often went missing without anyone being able to track them. Because of that, I decided to develop a software that could take care of the record keeping.
It had a lot of bugs at the early stages, which I had to fix, and eventually it was ready to be used. By that time though, I had to leave for school and my parents ended up not using the technology.
Why was the product not used?
My parents thought it was too stressful to use compared to what they had been used to. After my Masters in Information Systems, I learnt about the people aspect of building products. Most of the times, people design devices and products that they can use, while it may not necessarily be the best design for the other person. I had not paid enough attention to that part of the product development, and it showed after.
How did the journey into WTEC begin?
After my first undergraduate degree, I moved to the US to get another degree, this time in Applied Sciences. It was there that I really got to learn about programming and databases. I got my first job working as a researcher for a non-profit organization. I moved to a more technology-focused role which entailed building their website and managed their technology resources.
Oreoluwa Lesi
At the same time, I was also volunteering and doing what I could to give back to the community. I volunteered as help-desk IT personnel and they ask me to help out if any faults developed in their computers.
I started teaching basic digital literacy skills in a community technology center. I taught skills ranging from web design to Microsoft word. What struck me was that after some time, I would meet people I had taught who told me that they had gotten a job because of what they learnt in my class.
I began to think much more on it, and wondered at the impact that could have on women, because I have always had a heart for women.
During my NYSC year after I moved back to Nigeria, I took up a personal project of teaching girls how to blog. That expanded into teaching them how to use the computer. It was while doing that that I came across an email calling for applications for funding for projects that are building communities.
Although unsure at the time, I still applied and after some months I got a response that I had been shortlisted and was invited for a workshop in Uganda. I learnt a lot at the workshop, even though I was scared at first because the other participants came from big organizations and I didn’t even have a team then.
After the workshop, I had the opportunity of reworking my proposal for funding and submitting it again. I was later contacted that I had been selected for funding and that my proposal was the best ranked proposal of all, that was what really gave me the confidence and boost to start WTEC.
What was the first year of running WTEC like?
So, WTEC started fully in 2008, and that was a year that the country was in financial recession. The funding that we had gotten before was $5000, and we were looking for ways to raise more funds. It proved more difficult however, and we were not able to raise funding after the first one, during our first year.
Eventually, I decided with my team to pause our efforts on raising funds, and to concentrate on organizing programs and trainings for our target audience. These programs helped us to build our track record and provide content we could point people to as evidence of our activities on social media.
The passion I had for our work at WTEC kept and helped me and my team get through the early days of Women Technology Empowerment Center.
What are some of the programs and trainings that WTEC organises?
We started with programs that taught women digital skills such as blogging, and building and maintaining a Facebook page. But because part of our goals involves bridging the gender gap in the technology space, we realized that we needed to reach the females when they were still young and had not formed misconceptions about technology.
Oreoluwa Lesi’s W.TEC and 4 Other Organizations Won the 2019 Equals in Tech Awards in Berlin
To achieve that, we held our first bootcamp in 2008 with 15 girls and it was a huge success. We run the camp yearly now and we have increased the number to between 45 to 50 girls. The camp has been expanded beyond Lagos and now holds in Kwara and Anambra states yearly as well.
At the camp, we always set out to inspire girls about technology and to help them get a wider scope that does not limit technology to programming. Most girls think programming is all there is to tech, but it is not, and that is one thing we help them see at the camp.
We also run technology after school clubs to sustain the interest that the girls have developed from the camp. This is particularly helpful for girls who do not have access to computers at home. 
The clubs are run in schools and we schedule different activities to implement. The first program in the club was on digital filmmaking and we did that at Aunty Ayo’s International School in Ikoyi. From there, we went on to 10 more schools in Yaba and just went from there. We currently are doing the same thing in Kwara state.
Another of our initiatives is mentoring. We pair girls up with female leaders in fields that they are interested in. This helps them get practical guidance on how to navigate school and come out with their goals achieved and ready for the workplace.
What challenges and milestones have you faced while running WTEC?
We started at the beginning of the financial recession, and one of our major challenges was funding. However, it forced us to be nimble, adaptable and to think on our feet. As a result of that, we learnt to maximize resources and ideas to make the most impact possible.

https://technext.ng/2020/03/11/major-takeaways-from-women-in-tech-with-forbes-fellow-andrea-kamara-dunbar-founder-of-balancebowl/

Another challenge was not having a track record. The space of an NGO is that of trust and credibility. Partners and potential investors will not just want to look at your track record, they also want to know if you will do what you say you will do. These involve implementing projects to the letter, and following up where it is required.
I also had the challenge of nurturing the right relationships. I was more focused on the work in the beginning, and felt it should speak for itself, but at the end of the day I realized that businesses revolved around relationships. Often, people will invest in you usually because of you, not necessarily the idea, and I did not know this when I started out.
Another challenge was finding the right human resources. Getting people who shared the same passion for the job and were willing to learn on the job. It was challenging to get people who were committed to the duty of WTEC as an NGO and did not have money as their major motivation for getting into the field.
One of the challenges I personally had was managing and running my company. I was more comfortable facilitating and laying down programs, and most times I found out that communicating and running the team were aspects I had not really factored in. Taking courses and learning about these areas can help anyone to be better prepared than I was, then.
A major milestone for us is seeing girls decide to study STEM-related courses because of what they picked up at WTEC events. It is huge for us, especially when we see the girls taking on tech projects and making a difference with the skills they learnt at our events.

https://technext.ng/2019/12/18/5-women-that-defined-the-nigerian-tech-space-in-2019/

Another milestone for us is the fact that we have been able to bring the knowledge of technology to children with disabilities. The program came about through a conversation with the Founder of the Children’s Development Center, Dr Yinka Akindare. Through the program, we have been able to use tech to help them learn better, and we have gotten positive feedback for our efforts. 
Besides your role in WTEC, what else do you enjoy doing?
I run the bookshop my parents retired from in Surulere, the bookshop is called Patabah. I am married now with children, and having a family has helped me with my work-life balance.
The things I love doing include reading books, watching my favorite movies on Netflix and catching up with my favorite shows on YouTube, besides spending time with my family.
What are your favorite tech products?
That would be my phone and my iPad. I organize everything and handle my communications on my phone and I watch my movies and shows on my iPad.
For softwares, my favorite would be Google Calendar. I use it a lot to plan ahead and schedule my events.
As we wrapped up what was a very interesting and enlightening interview, Ore shared that over the coming years, WTEC would be doing a lot more documentation of its activities, and its mentors. There will be more reach for the organization for its activities and a lot more use of its aluni network.
Even as she keeps working to get a better work-life balance, it is inspiring what she has already achieved and a statement of the fact that women do not need to be perfect or to know it all before they can work at things that make others better.

‘Limiting Mindsets Prevent Women from Making the Most of Tech Communities’ – Temilade Adelakun	"Tech communities are an important part of the sector and the ones in student environments have proven to be both foundational and pivotal for many young people. These communities usually organize free training and forums where anyone curious enough to attend can get some more insight into what tech is all about.
This was the case about 5 years ago when a tech community organized a training on frontend web development in the Mechanical Engineering department of the University of Ibadan. Temilade Adelakun was one of the attendees at the training and it was to be the start of something new and exciting for her.


“The trainer was a lady and I was wowed that a lady could teach frontend web development and know her onions so well. I was inspired and felt that if she could do it then I could and would do it as well.”Temilade Adelakun
Temilade is currently the Co-organizer of the Google Developers Club in Ibadan as well as the Women Techmakers Ambassador also in Ibadan. Google Developers Club is one of the numerous tech communities that enthusiasts can join in tertiary institutions. Others include the Developers Student Club, Google Developers Club, Institute of Electrical Engineers, DevCareers and so on. 
Although some of these communities sound techy, they are open to everyone from all walks of life provided they have an interest in tech. They provide a space for people to learn, collaborate, grow and network with other techies and Temilade took advantage of it. 
Temilade Adelakun
Despite the efforts being put in by these communities, however, the gap between men and women inclusion in the tech space is still wide. As a woman in tech who has been an active part of tech student communities, Temilade agrees that one of the major challenges is that women join communities and do nothing to change their mindset of “tech is not for women”.
Most women cave in to stereotypes within tech communities
Where stereotypes are concerned, there are enough to keep women out of tech. Mindsets like “Tech is too hard for women”, “Coding is for men”, “Women are better off as nurses”, “Women can’t do tech because they are weaker”, “Women are emotional and tech is analytical so they will not mix well” and other limiting expressions, are a dime a dozen. 
“I heard the story of a lady at an internship program who was given a task to do alongside another lady and a man and she was finding the task difficult. She said ‘I don’t think this is for me, I have tried my best. Afterall, they have told me that tech is not for women and it’s hard to code,'” Temilade said.
Looking back on her own beginning, she noted that when she attended tech events and meetups while in school, she got a lot of silly questions like, ‘Are you sure it is people like you that they are looking for?’ ‘Are you going there to look for a man?’ etc.

She concluded that some of these mindsets easily catch up with women and subconsciously influence or dictate their performances in tech communities. Since these mindsets are  learnt at some point or the other, they should be unlearned and new things relearned.
As such, tech communities can do better by bringing in more women in tech to see, talk to and inspire younger ladies to embrace tech careers. There is nothing bad about men teaching people how to code but if we are encouraging more women to go into tech then we should see more women teaching tech. 
Why I joined tech was because my first tech training was by a lady. I felt that if she could do it, then so can I. The fact that she knew her onions thoroughly gingered me.Temilade
“If all we see are men, then we start to feel that maybe we don’t have women who are proficient in the field. Tech communities should bring out more of women role models,” she added.
Scribbling her Codes
One of the challenges that women face in tech communities is lack of resources. Having access to a good laptop as well as internet is essential when developing a tech skill. Students do not usually have that.

“When I started learning how to code, in my first and second year, I did not have a personal laptop. I was always borrowing people’s laptop to use when they were not using them,” Temilade said.
Temilade at a meetup
She would write her codes on paper, take them to her room in the university and run them on her roommate’s laptop when it was not in use. “I took pictures of the errors I got or wrote them down and worked on them till the codes ran properly. The absence of these resources can reduce how much people learn from tech communities.”

She also noted that sponsoring is as important as mentoring, otherwise, the women who are mentored and who venture into tech may not leave the starting point quickly. Women-led tech startups also need more funding and sponsorship from investors to ensure that more women are growing to become mentors and supports for the upcoming ones.
Tech communities will always focus on coding tools instead of no-coding tools
No-coding tech is an aspect of tech that is generating more appeal gradually. Zoom recently awarded a grant to Kabakoo, an edtech startup that teaches no-code tech skills to students in Africa. These no-code tools include Zapier, Bubble, Adalo, Wix and WordPress among others. 
However, in most tech communities, it is not gaining grounds fast and Temilade says one of the reasons is because coding skills are more important for anyone who wants to go far in the space.
“No-code tools make your work easier and faster but if you want to go far in the tech world, it is best that you have an understanding of coding and how it works. You don’t really need tech communities to teach you how to use no-code tools. Video tutorials can help you create a tech product in a shorter time with no-code tools but you can do a lot more when you are proficient in coding,” she said.
Getting better in coding goes hand in hand with practical applications of the  coding snippets that are learnt each day. For a young lady learning how to code, cloning popular apps like YouTube and Twitter, Piggyvest and Cowrywise etc will sharpen the student’s coding skills, build a portfolio along the side and increase her confidence level when collaborating with others.
Temilade telling younger people about STEM and the Tech space
Things are getting better in the tech space, however, and there are more women now than there were some years back. The gap between men and women in the industry is reducing and we need to keep creating awareness about tech in a way that lets everyone see that both men and women should  be duly involved.
