# probable package

# Summary of the package

This package can be used to calculate:
- the mean 
- standard deviation 
- probability density function
of the Gaussian and Binomial distribution

It can also be used to plot:
- the histrogram of the distribution
- and the normalized histogram of the data and also plot the probability density function along the same range

The package can and also be used to magically add identical distribution together.

# Files details
- Generaldistribution.py: contains the base class from which the Gaussian and Binomial class inherit their functionalities
- GaussianDtribution.py: contains the module the houses the functionalities listed above for the Gaussian class
- Binomialdtribution.py: contains the module the houses the functionalities listed above but this time, for the Binomial class
